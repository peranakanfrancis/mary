&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t you realize that those who work in the temple get their meals from the offerings brought to the temple? And those who serve at the altar get a share of the sacrificial offerings. - [1 Corinthians 9:13]

&lt;p>Greetings in the Lord !&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With joy and gratitude in our hearts, I invite you to join me in thanking the MEP Priests who journeyed with the community of Permatang Tinggi from 1893 to 1914. The present Church of the Holy Name of Mary, Permatang Tinggi was built in 1928 during the tenure of Fr. Michael Seet, the first local priest, who served in the parish from 1914 to 1919, and again from 1921 to 1937. Ninety years later activity centre, to cater for an even larger community that is expected to expand further due to the housing developments and the new township that is emerging in areas close to the parish.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Church considers the Mass the greatest possible prayer of intercession because it is the perfect offering of Christ to the Father by making present the Paschal Mystery of His death and resurrection. It is a longstanding tradition in the Church that a Priest may be requested to offer a Mass for a specific intention, even when one cannot be physically present at the Mass.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You may submit the mass offering request form securely online with [ˆ1]Stripe online payment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Or fill in the form &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/Rdt16hMQpCxBWVuX9">here&lt;/a> and attach a banking slip.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Otherwise, please walk in to the parish office to have your mass offering handled by our admin office.&lt;/li>
