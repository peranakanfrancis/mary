### Gospel
> No disciple is above his teacher, no slave above his master. It is enough for the disciple that he become like his teacher, for the slave that he become like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of his household! "Therefore do not be afraid of them. Nothing is concealed that will not be revealed, nor secret that will not be known. What I say to you in the darkness, speak in the light; what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops. And do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather, be afraid of the one who can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna. Are not two sparrows sold for a small coin? Yet not one of them falls to the ground without your Father's knowledge. Even all the hairs of your head are counted. So do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows. Everyone who acknowledges me before others I will acknowledge before my heavenly Father. But whoever denies me before others, I will deny before my heavenly Father.

### Reflection
Today Jesus has a litany of wise sayings. He begins by saying that “No disciple is above his teacher, nor a slave above his master.” Rather, the disciple is to become like his or her teacher and the slave to become like his or her master.

Jesus then shares many more proverbs with his disciples. He talks about light and darkness, whispering and proclaiming. He tells his disciples that there is no need to be afraid. Everything will be revealed and all secrets will be made known. Jesus also talks about the body and the soul, the value of two small sparrows and even the hairs on their heads.

Jesus is making the point that God knows everything about us, down to the number of hairs we have on our heads. God cares deeply about each of us and God always will take care of us. We do not need to be afraid, even when life is difficult. The challenge for us is that when life is painful and difficult, most of us naturally become afraid. It is not that we don’t have faith in Jesus. Rather, we simply may be overwhelmed by the challenges and difficulties in our lives. And it may seem that there is no way out!

At these times, today’s Gospel is a reading worth returning to. Jesus tells us: “Even the hairs of your head are counted! So do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.” Today I invite you to bring any worries or anxieties you have to Jesus. Simply place your worries or your pain in his hands (figuratively) and then sit quietly with Jesus for 5-10 minutes. May Jesus bless you with deep trust and deep peace!
