### Gospel
> 4 When a large crowd gathered, with people from one town after another journeying to him, he spoke in a parable.

> 5 "A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some seed fell on the path and was trampled, and the birds of the sky ate it up.

> 6 Some seed fell on rocky ground, and when it grew, it withered for lack of moisture.

> 7 Some seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew with it and choked it.

> 8 And some seed fell on good soil, and when it grew, it produced fruit a hundredfold." After saying this, he called out, "Whoever has ears to hear ought to hear."

> 9 Then his disciples asked him what the meaning of this parable might be.

> 10 He answered, "Knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of God has been granted to you; but to the rest, they are made known through parables so that 'they may look but not see, and hear but not understand.'

> 11 "This is the meaning of the parable. The seed is the word of God.

> 12 Those on the path are the ones who have heard, but the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts that they may not believe and be saved.

> 13 Those on rocky ground are the ones who, when they hear, receive the word with joy, but they have no root; they believe only for a time and fall away in time of trial.

> 14 As for the seed that fell among thorns, they are the ones who have heard, but as they go along, they are choked by the anxieties and riches and pleasures of life, and they fail to produce mature fruit.

> 15 But as for the seed that fell on rich soil, they are the ones who, when they have heard the word, embrace it with a generous and good heart, and bear fruit through perseverance.

### Reflection:
Today Jesus tells the large crowd gathered around him the parable of the ‘sower and the seed.’ Most of us know this parable by heart. As we know, a sower went out to sow his seed. Some of the seeds fell on a frequently used path. Naturally, when the seeds sprouted, the seedlings were trampled by the travelers who used the path or by the birds that ate the seeds before they could sprout. Other seeds landed on rocky ground. When these seeds sprouted, they withered from lack of rain. However, some seeds fell on good soil. These seeds grew and produced a rich harvest of a hundredfold.

Jesus then tells his listeners: “Whoever has ears to hear ought to hear.” This parable is very familiar to us. Familiarity can be a good thing but at times, it keeps us from truly listening to Jesus’ word. Often, we are like children who know what their parent will say to them before they utter the words.

Today I invite you to reflect on the question: Has Jesus’ seed fallen on your path and been trampled on by a day full of activities? Or has his seed fallen on rocky and hard ground that has not been softened by the rain of his love, and the seed has withered away? Or has Jesus’ seed fallen on good ground that was moist and receptive to the seed? Each day we have the opportunity to receive the seed Jesus gives us for that specific day. He doesn’t give us the same seed every day. He knows what we need for this day. However, we are the ones who need to be attentive, open and receptive to the seed. We can nurture it and help it grow and blossom. Or we can ignore it and then it will never grow, develop and produce fruit. It is our choice! What will we choose today?
