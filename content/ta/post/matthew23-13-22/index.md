title: Matthew 23:13-22
subtitle: 'All of us have a Pharisee within us.  It would be wonderful if we always practiced what we preached.  However, the reality is that, at times, we fail to do this.  In a crazy way, this has the potential to be a blessing.  Knowing that we fail at times may enable us to be more understanding and compassionate when others fail. We are human after all and thus, we never will be perfect.  May we pray for the grace to forgive ourselves when we fail!'

### Gospel
> 13 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites. You lock the kingdom of heaven before human beings. You do not enter yourselves, nor do you allow entrance to those trying to enter.

> 15 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites. You traverse sea and land to make one convert, and when that happens you make him a child of Gehenna twice as much as yourselves.

> 16 “Woe to you, blind guides, who say, ‘If one swears by the temple, it means nothing, but if one swears by the gold of the temple, one is obligated.’

> 17 Blind fools, which is greater, the gold, or the temple that made the gold sacred?

> 18 And you say, ‘If one swears by the altar, it means nothing, but if one swears by the gift on the altar, one is obligated.’

> 19 You blind ones, which is greater, the gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred?

> 20 One who swears by the altar swears by it and all that is upon it;

> 21 one who swears by the temple swears by it and by him who dwells in it;

> 22 one who swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by him who is seated on it.

### Reflection
Today’s Gospel is really a downer! It is the passage in which Jesus berates the scribes and the Pharisees and accuses them of being hypocrites. They act holy, but they often take advantage of the individuals who have much less than they do.  Their actions do not always exemplify what they preach.

All of us have a Pharisee within us.  It would be wonderful if we always practiced what we preached.  However, the reality is that, at times, we fail to do this.  In a crazy way, this has the potential to be a blessing.  Knowing that we fail at times may enable us to be more understanding and compassionate when others fail. We are human after all and thus, we never will be perfect.  May we pray for the grace to forgive ourselves when we fail!
