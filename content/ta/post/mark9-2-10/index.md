### Gospel
> 2 After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John and led them up a high mountain apart by themselves. And he was transfigured before them,

> 3 and his clothes became dazzling white, such as no fuller on earth could bleach them.

> 4 Then Elijah appeared to them along with Moses, and they were conversing with Jesus.

> 5 Then Peter said to Jesus in reply, "Rabbi, it is good that we are here! Let us make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."

> 6 He hardly knew what to say, they were so terrified.

> 7 Then a cloud came, casting a shadow over them; then from the cloud came a voice, "This is my beloved Son. Listen to him."

> 8 Suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone but Jesus alone with them.

> 9 As they were coming down from the mountain, he charged them not to relate what they had seen to anyone, except when the Son of Man had risen from the dead.

> 10 So they kept the matter to themselves, questioning what rising from the dead meant.

### Reflection
Today Peter, James and John experience the Transfiguration of Jesus. Jesus took these three men up to the top of a mountain. When they arrived there, Jesus was transfigured before them. First, his clothing became dazzling white and then Elijah and Moses appeared and began conversing with Jesus.

After a time, Peter said to Jesus: “Rabbi, it is good that we are here!” Peter then proposed that three tents be erected: one each for Jesus, one for Elijah and one for Moses. Then a cloud cast a shadow over them and from the cloud, a voice spoke: “This is my beloved Son! Listen to him!” In that instant, Elijah and Moses disappeared and once again the disciples were alone with Jesus. Imagine what went through the disciples’ minds and hearts while all this was occurring. Did they think they were hallucinating? Or were they simply struggling to absorb and understand what they had experienced?

Jesus then instructs his disciples not to tell anyone what they had just experienced. He also told them not to speak of this incident until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead. The disciples did not know what to make of Jesus’ words. They continued to ponder the meaning of the question: “what does rising from the dead” mean?

Have you ever had the experience of hearing or sensing God saying to you: “You are my beloved.” Today I invite you to sit quietly and allow God to speak those words to you. Allow yourself to absorb the reality that you truly are the beloved of God. Imagine yourself being enveloped by God’s love and care for 10 minutes or so. God’s love also has the power to also transfigure us!

After a time, thank God for this incredible gift! God appreciates a loving thank you!
