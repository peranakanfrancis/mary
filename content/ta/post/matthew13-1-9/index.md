### Gospel
> On that day, Jesus went out of the house and sat down by the sea. Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat down, and the whole crowd stood along the shore. And he spoke to them at length in parables, And as he sowed, some seed fell on the path, and birds came and ate it up. Some fell on rocky ground, where it had little soil. It sprang up at once because the soil was not deep, and when the sun rose it was scorched, and it withered for lack of roots. Some seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it. But some seed fell on rich soil, and produced fruit, a hundred or sixty or thirtyfold. Whoever has ears ought to hear.

### Reflection
Today Jesus and the disciples are on the shore of the Sea of Galilee.  Jesus was teaching the people in the form of a parable.  He told his listeners the Parable of the Wheat and the Weeds.  This is a very familiar parable to us.  However, this parable was new to His listeners.  They asked Jesus: “Why do you use stories when you teach the people”?  

Now pause a moment and think back to your childhood.  What was your favorite story when you were young?  What was it about the story that captured your imagination?  Most stories have a message.  What was the message you learned from your favorite story?

Today I invite you to sit an ponder the personal story that Jesus is telling you in this Gospel reading.  He has a specific message for you today.  It may be about your weeds.  However, it also may be a loving and tender message.   Sit quietly for a time and allow your message from Jesus to emerge from the silence.

Be expectant!  The message that you receive will be for you alone.  Cherish Jesus’ presence with you.  Open your heart to His love for you.  Enjoy being in Jesus’ presence, in the presence of pure love.  For what more could we ask?
