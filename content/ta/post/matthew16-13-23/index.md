### Gospel
> 13 When Jesus went into the region of Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?”

> 14 They replied, “Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”

> 15 He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?”

> 16 Simon Peter said in reply, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.”

> 17 Jesus said to him in reply, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah. For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my heavenly Father.

> 18 And so I say to you, you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it.

> 19 I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”

> 20 Then he strictly ordered his disciples to tell no one that he was the Messiah.

> 21 From that time on, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer greatly from the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed and on the third day be raised.

> 22 Then Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, “God forbid, Lord! No such thing shall ever happen to you.”

> 23 He turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are an obstacle to me. You are thinking not as God does, but as human beings do.”

### Reflection
In today’s Gospel, Jesus travelled to the region of Caesarea Philippi. Jesus asked his disciples: “Who do people say that the Son of Man is”? The disciples replied: “Some say that you are John the Baptist, Elijah, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” Then Jesus looked directly at his disciples and asked: “But who do you say that I am?" Immediately Simon Peter looked at Jesus and said: “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”

Jesus then looked at Simon Peter and said: “Blessed are you, Simon! This has been revealed to you by my Father. And I say to you, you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it.”  Jesus plays on Peter's name which is the same word for"rock.  To call someone a "rock" is a great compliment.

Faith in Jesus makes us into "rocks" or "spiritual stones."  Sometime we are personally tested with the same question that Jesus asks of his discipes: "Who do you say that I am?"
