> 37 now there was a sinful woman in the city who learned that he was at table in the house of the pharisee. bringing an alabaster flask of ointment,

> 38 she stood behind him at his feet weeping and began to bathe his feet with her tears. then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them, and anointed them with the ointment.

> 39 when the pharisee who had invited him saw this he said to himself, "if this man were a prophet, he would know who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, that she is a sinner."

> 40 jesus said to him in reply, "simon, i have something to say to you." "tell me, teacher," he said.

> 41 "two people were in debt to a certain creditor; one owed five hundred days' wages and the other owed fifty.

> 42 since they were unable to repay the debt, he forgave it for both. which of them will love him more?"

> 43 simon said in reply, "the one, i suppose, whose larger debt was forgiven." he said to him, "you have judged rightly."

> 44 then he turned to the woman and said to simon, "do you see this woman? when i entered your house, you did not give me water for my feet, but she has bathed them with her tears and wiped them with her hair.

> 45 you did not give me a kiss, but she has not ceased kissing my feet since the time i entered.

> 46 you did not anoint my head with oil, but she anointed my feet with ointment.

> 47 so i tell you, her many sins have been forgiven; hence, she has shown great love. but the one to whom little is forgiven, loves little."

> 48 he said to her, "your sins are forgiven."

> 49 the others at table said to themselves, "who is this who even forgives sins?"

> 50 but he said to the woman, "your faith has saved you; go in peace."

### Reflection:
This Gospel begins with a Pharisee inviting Jesus to dinner. Jesus entered the Pharisee’s home and reclined at table. Then unexpectedly a woman appears behind Jesus. Luke writes: “She was a sinful woman.” The woman had heard that Jesus was in the city and when she found out that he was at the home of the Pharisee, she immediately went to the house and entered.

The woman had brought an alabaster flask of ointment. She stood behind Jesus at his feet, weeping. The woman began to bath Jesus’ feet with her tears. She then wiped his feet with her hair and anointed them with ointment. Simon, Jesus’ host, watched all of this. And as he was watching, he also was judging Jesus and judging the woman. Finally, Simon said to himself: “If this man truly is a prophet, surely he would recognize that the woman bathing his feet and touching him is a sinner.” And most likely Simon’s disapproval was written all over his face.

Jesus was well aware of what Simon was thinking. Jesus looked at Simon and gave him the familiar scenario of the two debtors who owed money to a creditor: one five hundred days’ wages and the other fifty days’ wages. Neither creditor was able to repay the debt. When the creditor realized that neither one had the money to repay him, he generously forgave their debt. Imagine the shock the debtors must have experienced at the creditor’s generosity. They must have been overwhelmed with amazement and gratitude.

Then Jesus asks Simon: “Which one of these men will love him more?” Naturally Simon answered: “The one who owed the most money.” I wonder if the Pharisee truly grasped the point Jesus was making? Did he even begin to comprehend what Jesus was saying to him? Or was he so entrenched in his own belief system that what Jesus said was ludicrous to him?

I wonder how we would react if this scene were reenacted in our lives? Would we also be shocked by Jesus’ actions? Would we comprehend the great gift Jesus gave to this woman? Would we criticize Jesus just as Simon did? Or would we be astonished by Jesus’ gentle loving and forgiving spirit, no matter how great the woman’s sin had been?

The good news for us is that when we are the sinner, Jesus will love and forgive us just as he lovingly forgave this woman. Do we believe and trust this reality? Let us come to him and be forgiven!
