### Gospel
> 24 When the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they themselves got into boats and came to Capernaum looking for Jesus.

> 25 And when they found him across the sea they said to him, "Rabbi, when did you get here?"

> 26 Jesus answered them and said, "Amen, amen, I say to you, you are looking for me not because you saw signs but because you ate the loaves and were filled.

> 27 Do not work for food that perishes but for the food that endures for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him the Father, God, has set his seal."

> 28 So they said to him, "What can we do to accomplish the works of God?"

> 29 Jesus answered and said to them, "This is the work of God, that you believe in the one he sent."

> 30 So they said to him, "What sign can you do, that we may see and believe in you? What can you do?

> 31 Our ancestors ate manna in the desert, as it is written: 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'"

> 32 So Jesus said to them, "Amen, amen, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave the bread from heaven; my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.

> 33 For the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world."

> 34 So they said to him, "Sir, give us this bread always."

> 35 Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me will never hunger, and whoever believes in me will never thirst.

### Reflection
In today’s gospel the people are hungry to hear Jesus preach and teach. Since they could not find Jesus or his disciples, many of them got into boats and went to Capernaum to look for him. When they found him, they asked him: “When did you get here?” Why did they ask him this particular question? They had found him and wasn’t that what they had hoped for? Perhaps they did not know what else to say to Jesus.

Jesus says to them: “You are looking for me not because you saw signs and wonders. You come to me only because you ate your fill of the loaves!” Jesus then tells them not to work for “food that perishes but rather for food that will truly satisfy your (spiritual) hunger.”

Today may be a good day to take some time and ask ourselves: why do we come to Jesus? Do we have an agenda when we come to Jesus? Do we give him a laundry list of requests? Or do we come and spend time with him simply because we long to be in his presence? I pray it is the latter!
