### Gospel
> 1 While the crowd was pressing in on Jesus and listening to the word of God, he was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret.

> 2 He saw two boats there alongside the lake; the fishermen had disembarked and were washing their nets.

> 3 Getting into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, he asked him to put out a short distance from the shore. Then he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat.

> 4 After he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, "Put out into deep water and lower your nets for a catch."

> 5 Simon said in reply, "Master, we have worked hard all night and have caught nothing, but at your command I will lower the nets."

> 6 When they had done this, they caught a great number of fish and their nets were tearing.

> 7 They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come to help them. They came and filled both boats so that they were in danger of sinking.

> 8 When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at the knees of Jesus and said, "Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man."

> 9 For astonishment at the catch of fish they had made seized him and all those with him,

> 10 and likewise James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners of Simon. Jesus said to Simon, "Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching men."

> 11 When they brought their boats to the shore, they left everything and followed him.

### Reflection
In today’s Gospel, Jesus calls his first disciples. Jesus was proclaiming the word of God at the Lake of Gennesaret. As he was standing by the lake, he saw two boats on the shore. The fishermen had just come in from the lake. They were washing their nets and cleaning their boats.

Jesus went over to them and climbed into Simon’s boat. I wonder how Simon reacted to this man climbing into his boat without saying a word to him. In today’s world, it would be like a stranger getting into your car when you are stopped at an intersection. Jesus boldly asked Simon to row out a short distance from the shore. Simon did so. Then from the boat, Jesus began to teach the crowds.

When Jesus finished his teaching, he told Simon to put out into the deep water and then to lower his nets. I wonder what Simon’s inner reaction was when Jesus told him what to do? After all, Peter was a professional fisherman. He had been doing this for years. Simon’s response to Jesus implies that he was a bit aggravated. He skeptically tells him: “We fished all night long and caught nothing. However, I will do as you command.” And as we know, they caught such a great number of fish that their nets were unable to bear the weight of the catch and they began to tear. Simon and the other fishermen called out to the men in other boats to come and help them. They had caught so many fish that the fishermen were afraid that both the boats would sink.

All of the men were amazed at the size of the catch. They had never caught such an enormous number of fish at one time. Simon Peter was filled with awe and wonder. He fell at the knees of Jesus and said: “Jesus, depart from me for I am a sinful man.” Jesus responded to him and said: “Don’t be afraid. From now on you will be catching men (and women).” The disciples were so astonished at this miracle that they left their families and homes to follow Jesus.

Most likely, we will not be fishing today (at least for fish). However, if we keep our eyes and hearts open, we may recognize the abundance of Jesus’ gift to us. It may be the love and care we experience from others. Or it may be that your day goes well and you experience satisfaction at all you were able to accomplish. For many human beings, it almost is a natural tendency to focus on what goes wrong in our day rather than what our blessings have been. True, something may go wrong but there may be many more instances of what has gone well. Be alert and be thankful!
