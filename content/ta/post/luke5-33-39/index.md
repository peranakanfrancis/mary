### Gospel
> 33 And they said to him, "The disciples of John fast often and offer prayers, and the disciples of the Pharisees do the same; but yours eat and drink."

> 34 Jesus answered them, “Can you make the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them?

> 35 But the days will come, and when the bridegroom is taken away from them, then they will fast in those days."

> 36 And he also told them a parable. "No one tears a piece from a new cloak to patch an old one. Otherwise, he will tear the new and the piece from it will not match the old cloak.

> 37 Likewise, no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be spilled, and the skins will be ruined.

> 38 Rather, new wine must be poured into fresh wineskins.

> 39 (And) no one who has been drinking old wine desires new, for he says, 'The old is good.'"

### Reflection
Today, the Pharisees are criticizing Jesus for not being ascetical enough. In their eyes Jesus and his disciples should be fasting and praying more — a lot more! They think that Jesus should be as ascetical as John the Baptist and as ascetical as they are.

It is so tempting to criticize and judge others on the basis of what we see and observe. This is exactly what the Pharisees do in today’s Gospel. In their eyes, Jesus should be more like John the Baptist, eating locusts and wild honey. We all have our own standards of what we think is best and how others should act. However, I assume that most of us don’t appreciate it when another person criticizes or judges us simply by observing our behavior.

Jesus invites his listeners to look at the situation in a different way. He tells them that he is doing something new. Are we open to the new that Jesus may be inviting us to? This may be an uncomfortable invitation. Like the Pharisees, I can get comfortable with the ways things have always been. I may be tempted to criticize another person who is not doing things the way I think they should be done. Jesus is challenging the Pharisees, and us, to be open to other ways of doing things. He is challenging them not to judge others so quickly. Today may we be mindful of not jumping to judgment!
