### Gospel
> 38 After he left the synagogue, he entered the house of Simon. Simon's mother-in-law was afflicted with a severe fever, and they interceded with him about her.

> 39 He stood over her, rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up immediately and waited on them.

> 40 At sunset, all who had people sick with various diseases brought them to him. He laid his hands on each of them and cured them.

> 41 And demons also came out from many, shouting, "You are the Son of God." But he rebuked them and did not allow them to speak because they knew that he was the Messiah.

> 42 At daybreak, Jesus left and went to a deserted place. The crowds went looking for him, and when they came to him, they tried to prevent him from leaving them.

> 43 But he said to them, "To the other towns also I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God, because for this purpose I have been sent."

> 44 And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judea.

### Reflection
Today we experience the healing power of Jesus. After leaving the synagogue, Jesus went to the home of Simon. When he arrived, Simon’s mother-in-law was very ill with a high fever. Her family was hoping that Jesus would pray with her, but ultimately they were hoping that Jesus would heal and fully restore her health. When Jesus arrived at the home, he went to the woman. He rebuked the fever and immediately the woman was fully restored. She got up from her bed and began to serve them.

At sunset, many people who were ill were brought to Jesus. They had a variety of diseases. Jesus laid his hands on each of them and they were cured. Demons came out from some of the people and they began to shout at Jesus: “You are the Son of God.” However, Jesus firmly rebuked them. He did not allow them to speak because they recognized that he was the Christ.

At daybreak, tired and weary, Jesus left town to find a deserted place. He needed some time to rest, pray and be alone. However, the crowd came looking for him and tried to prevent him from leaving. (Who wouldn’t want a healer close by?) However, Jesus firmly told them that he must go and proclaim the good news of the Kingdom.

Jesus calls each of us to proclaim the good news of the Kingdom. We are his disciples in our world and we are called to share his love and message with our world. I invite you to take ten minutes or so today and ask yourself: Do I proclaim the good news of the Kingdom in my small corner of the world? Or do I ignore Jesus’ call and depend on others to proclaim the good news of the Kingdom?

As Christians and disciples of Jesus, each one of us is his messenger. Today I invite you to share Jesus’ good news in small and simple ways. Most people typically don’t like being preached to. However, they may appreciate a subtle reminder of what we all are called to be and to do. Spread the good news today! You may find that you enjoy sharing good news with the people you encounter.
