### Gospel
> 18 Once when Jesus was praying in solitude, and the disciples were with him, he asked them, "Who do the crowds say that I am?"

> 19 They said in reply, "John the Baptist; others, Elijah; still others, 'One of the ancient prophets has arisen.'"

> 20 Then he said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" Peter said in reply, "The Messiah of God."

> 21 He rebuked them and directed them not to tell this to anyone.

> 22 He said, "The Son of Man must suffer greatly and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed and on the third day be raised." 

### Reflection:
Today Jesus is praying in solitude and his disciples were there with him. After a time, Jesus turned to his disciples and asked: “Who do the people say that I am?” Clearly Jesus wanted some feedback from the disciples. They said in reply: “Some say you are John the Baptist. Others believe you are Elijah or one of the ancient prophets who has arisen.” Jesus then asked: “But who do you say that I am?”

Today Jesus asks each of us the question: “Who do you say that I am?” I invite you to take a few minutes and seriously ask yourself: who is Jesus to me? Who is Jesus for me now? How does his presence impact my life? Does it?

Jesus doesn’t want us simply to believe in him. Jesus desires a personal relationship with each of us. He wants to be the center of our lives. Is this what we desire? Or is Jesus just a figure in the Gospels for us? Have we opened the door of our hearts to him? Only we can make this choice. What will we choose today? Jesus is waiting!
