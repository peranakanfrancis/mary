### Gospel
> As they were going out, a demoniac who could not speak was brought to him, and when the demon was driven out the mute person spoke. The crowds were amazed and said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel." But the Pharisees said, "He drives out demons by the prince of demons." Jesus went around to all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and curing every disease and illness. At the sight of the crowds, his heart was moved with pity for them because they were troubled and abandoned, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is abundant but the laborers are few; so ask the master of the harvest to send out laborers for his harvest."

### Reflection
The focus of this Gospel is another healing story. Today a demoniac is brought to Jesus. This man also was mute. He had been unable to speak since the demon had taken possession of him. Jesus immediately drove the demon out of the man and the man once again was able to speak. All who witnessed this healing were amazed and awed. They had never seen anything like this in Israel. However, the Pharisees disagreed and criticized Jesus. They proclaimed: “He drives out demons by the prince of demons.” However, their statement did not deter the people from believing in Jesus.

Jesus then traveled on to many other villages and towns. He taught, he proclaimed the Gospel of the Kingdom and he healed many people of their diseases and illnesses. Many of the people that Jesus encountered were troubled and all alone. In his eyes, they were like sheep without a shepherd. Matthew writes: “Jesus’ heart was moved with pity for them.”

Ask yourself: Do you have demons you hope Jesus will drive out of you? What are your demons? What is the healing that you long for? Today open your heart to Jesus’ presence and his healing power. He will come to us! It may not be a dramatic instant healing. However, he is healing us and always, he is with us! Do we trust this? I pray we do!
