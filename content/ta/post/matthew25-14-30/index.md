title: Matthew 25:14-30
subtitle: How do we steward the resources that God has given us? Do we use them well and invest them wisely? Do we share them with others? Or do we hide them or dismiss them as insignificant? All our resources are given to us to share with others and the world. Do we believe that the resources or gifts we have are good enough?

### Gospel
> 14 “It will be as when a man who was going on a journey called in his servants and entrusted his possessions to them.

> 15 To one he gave five talents; to another, two; to a third, one--to each according to his ability. Then he went away. Immediately

> 16 the one who received five talents went and traded with them, and made another five

> 17 Likewise, the one who received two made another two.

> 18 But the man who received one went off and dug a hole in the ground and buried his master's money.

> 19 After a long time the master of those servants came back and settled accounts with them.

> 20 The one who had received five talents came forward bringing the additional five. He said, 'Master, you gave me five talents. See, I have made five more.'

> 21 His master said to him, 'Well done, my good and faithful servant. Since you were faithful in small matters, I will give you great responsibilities. Come, share your master's joy.'

> 22 (Then) the one who had received two talents also came forward and said, 'Master, you gave me two talents. See, I have made two more.'

> 23 His master said to him, 'Well done, my good and faithful servant. Since you were faithful in small matters, I will give you great responsibilities. Come, share your master's joy.'

> 24 Then the one who had received the one talent came forward and said, 'Master, I knew you were a demanding person, harvesting where you did not plant and gathering where you did not scatter;

> 25 so out of fear I went off and buried your talent in the ground. Here it is back.'

> 26 His master said to him in reply, 'You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I did not plant and gather where I did not scatter?

> 27 Should you not then have put my money in the bank so that I could have got it back with interest on my return?

> 28 Now then! Take the talent from him and give it to the one with ten.

> 29 For to everyone who has, more will be given and he will grow rich; but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.

> 30 And throw this useless servant into the darkness outside, where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.'

### Reflection
In this week’s Gospel, we hear a parable in which three workers are given a varying amount of talents. The one who has been given five talents by the master, comes back with five more, the one with two talents, comes back with two more, but the one with one talent went on to bury it in the ground, and he came back with nothing. The master was understandably upset, and he rebukes the last one by saying, “For to everyone who has, more will be given and he will grow rich; but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.”

The English word talent comes from the Latin word talentum, which refers to a worker’s wages or sum of money.  In this parable, we see the master giving his three servants differing amounts of money, only for the one with the smallest amount to not double what he has been given. Out of fear of his master, he buried the talent and earned nothing in return. 

Everything that we have and will ever have in life is given to us by God. Our talents, being our unique and natural skills, are given to us by God, and it is our duty as his children to use them to glorify him. Regardless of how much we are given, we are called to use our talents out of our love of God and our neighbor. When the time comes when we are paralyzed by fear, like the third servant, we must call upon the love of the Lord so that we may multiply the gifts that he has given us. We are constantly called to mirror the life of Christ, and it is evident that Jesus gave all he had, including his own life, for those he loved. Throughout the difficult times in my life, the image of the cross is something I look to when I am in need of strength and freedom from the bonds of fear. Jesus’ suffering on the cross is the perfect example of constantly giving all that we have in the service of God and our neighbors.
