### Gospel
> 31 Again he left the district of Tyre and went by way of Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, into the district of the Decapolis.

> 32 And people brought to him a deaf man who had a speech impediment and begged him to lay his hand on him.

> 33 He took him off by himself away from the crowd. He put his finger into the man's ears and, spitting, touched his tongue;

> 34 then he looked up to heaven and groaned, and said to him, "Ephphatha!" (that is, "Be opened!")

> 35 And (immediately) the man's ears were opened, his speech impediment was removed, and he spoke plainly.

> 36 He ordered them not to tell anyone. But the more he ordered them not to, the more they proclaimed it.

> 37 They were exceedingly astonished and they said, "He has done all things well. He makes the deaf hear and (the) mute speak."

### Reflection
Today Jesus travels to the Sea of Galilee and then to the district of Decapolis. When he arrived there, people brought to him a man who was deaf and who also had a speech impediment. They beseeched Jesus to lay his hand on the man. Jesus took the man away from the crowd, put his finger in the man’s ear, spit and touched the man’s tongue. Then Jesus looked up to heaven and uttered the word: “Ephaphatha!-- that is, “be opened.” Instantly, the man’s ears were opened and his speech impediment no longer existed. He could speak plainly!

Jesus ordered everyone not to tell anyone about the man’s healing. However, the people did not do as Jesus instructed them. They told everyone they met that Jesus had healed the deaf man. They praised Jesus saying: “He does all things well. He makes the deaf hear and the mute speak!” And word of this miracle spread throughout the town and the territory.

What is the impediment we long to be healed of? It may be a spiritual, psychological, physical or relational impediment. How does your impediment affect you, the people in your life and the quality of your life? Today beseech Jesus to begin healing your impediment. You may not receive a miracle, however, you may begin to notice a difference in your life in small and simple ways. Healing is a process. It happens gradually and over time. Be patient and yet persistent with Jesus. He will grace you!
