### Gospel
```
1. After this, Jesus went across the Sea of Galilee (of Tiberias).
2. A large crowd followed him, because they saw the signs he was performing on the sick.
3. Jesus went up on the mountain, and there he sat down with his disciples.
4. The Jewish feast of Passover was near.
5. When Jesus raised his eyes and saw that a large crowd was coming to him, he said to Philip, "Where can we buy enough food for them to eat?"
6. He said this to test him, because he himself knew what he was going to do.
7. Philip answered him, "Two hundred days' wages worth of food would not be enough for each of them to have a little (bit)."
8. One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, said to him, "
9. There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what good are these for so many?"
10. Jesus said, "Have the people recline." Now there was a great deal of grass in that place. So the men reclined, about five thousand in number.
11. Then Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed them to those who were reclining, and also as much of the fish as they wanted.
12. When they had had their fill, he said to his disciples, "Gather the fragments left over, so that nothing will be wasted."
13. So they collected them, and filled twelve wicker baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves that had been more than they could eat.
14. When the people saw the sign he had done, they said, "This is truly the Prophet, the one who is to come into the world."
15. Since Jesus knew that they were going to come and carry him off to make him king, he withdrew again to the mountain alone.
```

### Reflection
Today Jesus crosses the Sea of Galilee. However, a very large crowd followed him. They had witnessed the signs and healings that he had done for many people who were ill. And they hoped to see more wonders and healings.

When they arrived at the other side, Jesus and his disciples went up a mountain. However, Jesus looked down and saw that a great crowd of people had followed him. They had traveled quite a distance and Jesus knew that they would be hungry. However, there was no food available on the mountain.

Jesus asked Philip: “Do you have any idea where we can get enough food for all these people?” Philip tartly replied: “Two hundred days’ wages would not be enough money to pay for the amount of food this crowd would require.” Then Andrew spoke up. He told Jesus that a young boy in the crowd had five barley loaves and two fish. However, this would feed only a few people.

Jesus then tells the people sit down. He takes the loaves and the fish and gives thanks to God! Then Jesus instructs his disciples to distribute the bread and fish to the people. The disciples must have thought Jesus was crazy! Clearly the small portions of bread and fish would never feed all the people! However, as we know, there was abundance of food. Everyone had their fill and they had twelve baskets of leftovers! Where did all this food come from? Did Jesus simply multiply the food that the people had brought? Or was it that the people freely shared all that they had brought and thus, they had sufficient food for all the people?

At times in our lives, we also may feel that we do not have sufficient food. It may be that we believe that we do not have enough energy, money, time, talent or ??? (you fill in the blank)! At these times, it may be helpful to recall this Gospel passage! Jesus always gifts us with what we need. Truly we can trust his promise! It may not be what we thought it would be or perhaps what we hoped for. However, if we are open and trusting, Jesus will grace and bless us with what we truly need, even though it may not be what we asked for. Can we be content with this gift? I pray we will!
