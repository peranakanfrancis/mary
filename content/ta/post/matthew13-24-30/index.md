### Gospel
> He proposed another parable to them. "The kingdom of heaven may be likened to a man who sowed good seed in his field. While everyone was asleep his enemy came and sowed weeds all through the wheat, and then went off. When the crop grew and bore fruit, the weeds appeared as well. The slaves of the householder came to him and said, 'Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where have the weeds come from?' He answered, 'An enemy has done this.' His slaves said to him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?' He replied, 'No, if you pull up the weeds you might uproot the wheat along with them. Let them grow together until harvest; then at harvest time I will say to the harvesters, "First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles for burning; but gather the wheat into my barn."'"


### Reflection
Today’s Gospel begins with Jesus telling His disciples another parable.  The parable begins with the words:  “The kingdom of heaven may be likened to a man who sowed ‘good seed’ in his field.”  However, when everyone was asleep, an enemy came and sowed weeds in the wheat field. The enemy left deeply satisfied because he had “bested” his enemy.

As the crop began to grow, the weeds also grew.  The servants of the Master went to him and asked: “Master, did you not sow good seed in your field?  The field is filled with weeds!”  When the Master then realized what had happened, he told the slaves: “An enemy has done this.”  The slaves asked if they should uproot the weeds.  The Master told them to let the crops grow together.  Then, when it was time to harvest the crop He would instruct the harvesters to gather all the weeds and burn them.  When this was done, then they could safely gather the wheat.

What are the “weeds” in your life?  What is damage or difficulty that your “weeds” cause in your life?  Do you strive to uproot your “weeds” before they take root?  Naturally it is easier to pull up weeds when they first begin to grow.  At this point, the roots are tender and they do not yet have deep roots.   Yet, if we do not pull out our “weeds,” they will grow and flourish and establish deep roots.  Over time, the weeds likely will spread into the good soil and kill the healthy plants.

Most likely, we will never uproot all the weeds in our lives.  However, it we nurture the good seeds that we have sown, we will produce an abundant, if not perfect, harvest.
