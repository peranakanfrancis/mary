### Gospel
> He summoned the Twelve and began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over unclean spirits. He instructed them to take nothing for the journey but a walking stick--no food, no sack, no money in their belts. They were, however, to wear sandals but not a second tunic. He said to them, "Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave from there. Whatever place does not welcome you or listen to you, leave there and shake the dust off your feet in testimony against them." So they went off and preached repentance. They drove out many demons, and they anointed with oil many who were sick and cured them.

### Reflection
Today Jesus gathers the Twelve together and sends them out to preach and teach his message. He sends them out two by two. Jesus gave them a number of instructions: take nothing (and he means nothing) for the journey. They have the clothes on their body, the sandals on their feet and a walking stick. They were not to take a second tunic with them!

He also instructed them what to do when they entered a town. Whatever house they slept in the first night, they were to stay there until they left town. If they are not welcomed in a town, they should shake off the dust of that town when they leave there. With these instructions, the 12 disciples went off and began preaching repentance. They were able to drive out demons. They anointed the sick with oil and cured many people!

We are “Jesus’ Twelve” in today’s world. We also are to travel lightly, wear simple clothes and take a “walking stick” with us. We are not to take any money, food or other clothing! However, we can wear sandals (or maybe another style of shoes). Now, can you imagine yourself doing this? When was the last time you packed a suitcase? Did you double-check to be sure you had everything in it that you would need (and perhaps more than that)?

Are we willing to travel lightly, to leave home (our secure inner space) and venture into new territories? Are we willing to travel lightly and trust that if we need help, shelter or food, we will be cared for by the generosity of others and of God?

Do we believe that with Jesus’ grace, we also may drive out the demons of fear, shame, anger or pride, for ourselves and for others? Ask yourself: how do you strive to be a disciple of Jesus in your world?

Today Jesus is sending us forth! Will we follow in Jesus’ steps and do as he did? We are called! Will we respond?
