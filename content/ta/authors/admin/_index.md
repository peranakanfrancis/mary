Church of The Holy Name of Mary has existed for more than 127 years. It was built by Fr. Michael Seet in over 3 years period with overwhelming support and cooperation from the parishioners.

The history of the our church finds its origin from the Catholic Church of St. John the Baptist in Batu Kawan. When the early Chinese and Indian emigrants came to settle down there for agricultural purposes, the priests from the Assumption Church, Penang, followed to look after their spiritual and material needs.
