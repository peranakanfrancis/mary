### Make a Mass Offer
The Church considers the Mass the greatest possible prayer of intercession because it is the perfect offering of Christ to the Father by making present the Paschal Mystery of His death and resurrection. It is a longstanding tradition in the Church that a Priest may be requested to offer a Mass for a specific intention, even when one cannot be physically present at the Mass.

* Fill in the form [here](https://forms.gle/xbHsxiooVB3VVdpVA) and attach a banking slip.
* Otherwise, please walk in to the parish office to have your mass offering handled by our admin office.
