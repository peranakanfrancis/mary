# Course title, summary, and position.
linktitle: Communion
summary: No life flourishes without food and drink. Thus, the Eucharist offers the Body and Blood of Christ as food and drink for the spirit. As a ceremony, the Eucharist is both a meal that nourishes, as well as a sacrifice in which the death of Jesus is offered to the Father. The Eucharist is also the object of adoration among the faithful. Since the graces of all the other sacraments flow from the death and resurrection of Jesus, the Eucharist is considered the central sacrament of the Church.

## Flexibility

# This feature can be used for publishing content such as:

# * **Online courses**
# * **Project or software documentation**
# * **Tutorials**

# The `courses` folder may be renamed. For example, we can rename it to `docs` for software/project documentation or `tutorials` for creating an online course.

## Delete tutorials

# **To remove these pages, delete the `courses` folder and see below to delete the associated menu link.**

## Update site menu

# After renaming or deleting the `courses` folder, you may wish to update any `[[main]]` menu links to it by editing your menu configuration at `config/_default/menus.toml`.

# For example, if you delete this folder, you can remove the following from your menu configuration:

# ```toml
# [[main]]
#  name = "Courses"
#  url = "courses/"
#  weight = 50
#```

# Or, if you are creating a software documentation site, you can rename the `courses` folder to `docs` and update the associated *Courses* menu configuration to:

# ```toml
# [[main]]
#  name = "Docs"
#  url = "docs/"
#  weight = 50
# ```

## Update the docs menu

# If you use the *docs* layout, note that the name of the menu in the front matter should be in the form `[menu.X]` where `X` is the folder name. Hence, if you rename the `courses/example/` folder, you should also rename the menu definitions in the front matter of files within `courses/example/` from `[menu.example]` to `[menu.<NewFolderName>]`.

### What is the Communion?
There are three sacraments that are the foundation of Christian life. These sacraments are: Baptism, Confirmation, and Eucharist. They are given in this order to bring about the full initiation of the new Christian life. These three sacraments together are called the Sacraments of Initiation.

First Communion is the first time the Eucharist, Christ’s Body and Blood, is received after the Sacrament of Baptism and Confirmation have been received. Through the priest’s holy prayers, bread and wine becomes the Body and Blood of Christ. After the First Communion, we are able to continually receive the sacrament. Whenever we receive Holy Communion (Eucharist) in mass, we are receiving the Sacrament of the Eucharist. In receiving the Body and Blood of Christ and participating in mass continually, we become united in one body with the Church.


### Communion for children
Our First Holy Communion is designed as a faith journey for children between the age of five to nine years old, and their parents to take part in it together. First Holy Communion preparation begins two years earlier, and concludes with First Holy Communion Mass in 20th October 2021.

For your child to receive First Holy Communion, he or she must be enrolled in our Religious Education classes. Our Religious Education class registration for 2020 is now closed. Please check back in September 2021 for registration for the 2021 class.

### Communion for Adult
If you’re an adult seeking to receive your First Holy Communion or thinking about becoming a Catholic, your next step is [RCIA](rite-of-christian-initiation-of-adults).

### Preparation for Persons with Disabilities (OKU)
Church of The Holy Name of Mary understand that all Catholics have the right to participate in the sacraments. If you have a loved one (no matter what their age or disability is) who needs to prepare for any of the sacraments, please contact Father Louis at [+6045887799](tel:+6045887799) to book an appointment.
