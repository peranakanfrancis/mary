# Developing Great Faith

## “The Apostles said to the Lord, show us how to increase our faith.” (Luke 17:5)

Little faith can become great faith as we use it. As we take steps to trust God, we experience His faithfulness and that, in turn encourages us to have greater faith. As our faith develops and grows, our problems have less power over us and we worry less, that is something to be grateful for.

We can choose to think about what God can do instead of what we cannot do. If we continually think about the difficulty of our situation, we may end up in despair, and that means we feel unable to find a way out, we feel trapped, and then it is easy to panic and begin to do irrational things that only make the problem worse.

**But God always provides the way out (1 Corinthians 10:13).** Even though you might not see the way out right now, one does exist and God will reveal it as you trust Him.

### Prayer of Thanks
Father, I thank you that my faith can grow stronger as I put my trust in you. You are greater than any problem I will ever face. When I focus on you, I know that worry and despair will fade away. Thank you for your faithfulness and your work in my life.
