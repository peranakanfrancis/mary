# Do yourself  A Favour

> Then Peter came to Him and asked: "Lord, how often should I forgive someone who sins against me? Seven times? "No, not seven times," Jesus replied, "But seventy times seven times!" (Matthew 18:21-22)

As Christians, we should learn to be good at forgiving people, because we will be doing it all our lives. The truth is, when we forgive, we are actually doing ourselves a favour. Thankfully, God has given us a way to free ourselves from the agony of anger and pain that come with unforgiveness. We can choose to forgive.

As long as we live, we will encounter people who hurt us, reject us, disappoint us, use the wrong tone of voice with us, fail to understand us, or let us down in times of need. Those experiences are part of human nature and they come with relationships. Why should we ruin our lives over the bad behaviour of other people?

### Prayer of Thanks
Father, I thank you that my peace and joy are not determined by the actions of others. With Your help, I can forgive those who offend or hurt me. Thank you, Father, that You have forgiven me and You give me the grace to forgive others.
