## The Wedding At Cana (John 2:1-11)
> “They have no more wine.” John 2:3. “Do whatever He tells you.” John 2:5.

### 1. Jesus enjoying a wedding dinner.
Mary, Jesus and his disciples were enjoying a wedding dinner at Cana. Mary was quick to notice that the wine supply had ran out. A terrible embarrassment and humiliation to the bride and groom and the parents of the groom.

Mary instinctively turned to Jesus, “They have no more wine.” **John 2:3**.

Though Jesus replied, “My time has not yet come.” **John 2:4**.

Knowing Jesus well, Mary was confident that Jesus would somehow take care of the problem. So Mary instructed the servants, “Do whatever He tells you.” **John 2:5**.

Jesus told the servants, “Fill the jars with water.” **John 2:7**. “Now dip some out and take it to the master of ceremonies.” **John 2:8**.

The master of ceremonies tasted the water. It had turned into wine. This miraculous sign at Cana was the first time revealed His glory. The wonder worked by Jesus to show that he is the Messiah God had sent, and his disciples believed in Jesus. The wonder stimulated faith in Jesus and his divine mission.

### 2. Jesus turned water into wine for the guest to continue to enjoy the wedding dinner.
Jesus enjoys life. He wants everyone to enjoy life.
Jesus enjoyed life. “This made the Pharisees and teachers of religious laws complain that He was associating with such sinful people, even eating with them!” **Luke 15:2**.

### 3. Mary interceded for this bride and groom.
When the wine ran out, Mary interceded for the bride and groom with Jesus, “They have no more wine” **John 2:3**. Jesus replied, “My time has not yet come” **John 2:4**. But when the servants did “Do whatever he tells you.” **John 2:5**, water was turned into wine.

Likewise, when we ask Mary to intercede for us with Jesus, and “Do whatever He tells you” **John 2:5**. Do whatever we can on our part, water will turn into wine. God helps those who help themselves.

### 4. God wants you to enjoy your life.
Do you believe God wants you to enjoy your life? Well, He does! In fact, part of the will of God for you is for you to enjoy every moment of it. “So I decided there is nothing better than to enjoy food and drink and to find satisfaction in work. Then I realized that these pleasures are from the hand of God.” **Ecclesiastes 2:24**.

We should learn to value enjoyment because it is vital to being a balanced and healthy person. By the power of God, we can learn to be thankful for and enjoy all of life.

> “My purpose is to give them a rich and satisfying life.” John **10:10.**
