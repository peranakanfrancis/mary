### The Wise Men from the East
> “We saw His star as it rose, and we have come to worship Him.” Matthew 2:2.

### 1. Coming from the East

Wise men noticed the appearance of a new brilliant star. Signaling to them the birth of a great king who will bring in a new era of peace and prosperity. Following the star, the wise men arrived at Jerusalem.

### 2. Stop over at Jerusalem

When the wise men arrived in Jerusalem, the star receded from view. To make way for the wise men to encounter with the words of scripture. The wise men naturally enquired at the Palace of the King. “Where is the new born king of the Jews? We saw His star as it rose, and we have come to worship Him.” Matthew 2:2.

The answer given by king Herod, the leading priests and teachers of religious law “And you, O Bethlehem in the land of Judah, are not least among the ruling cities of Judah, for a ruler will come from you who will be the shepherd for my people Israel.” Matthew 2:6.

Having received a clue from the words of scripture, the wise men left Jerusalem to continue their search.

### 3. At Bethlehem

When the wise men left Jerusalem, the star reappeared. “When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.” Matthew 2:10. “It went ahead of them and stopped over the place where the child was.” Matthew 2:9.

And the star receded from view forever. Jesus will take over to guide the wise men.

“They entered the house and saw the child with His mother, Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped Him.” Matthew 2:11. The wise men do not simply kneel before the infant Jesus. They prostrated themselves on their faces and did Him homage. “Then they opened their treasure chests and gave Him gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh.” Matthew 2:11.

Gold is for Jesus, the King. Frankincense is for Jesus, the High Priest. Myrrh is for Jesus, the Prophet, who will be martyred. Myrrh is used to embalm the bodies of the dead.

### 4. Return home the East

Having encountered God in the infant Jesus, the wise men did not need the star anymore. “They returned to their own country by another route, for God had warned them in a dream not to return to Herod.” Matthew 2:12.

### 5. Applications

After guiding the wise men to “The place where the child was” Matthew 2:10 the star receded from view forever. Jesus will take over to guide the wise men. Likewise with Jesus, “the good shepherd” John 10:11 and “The light of the world.” John 8:12 with us, we do not need horoscope, fortune teller, medium and palmistry. ”See, I have written your name of the palms of my hands.” Isaiah 49:16.

### 6. The wise men, who through human eyes see only an ordinary infant in Bethlehem but by faith see so much more. They fall down and worship God in human flesh and offer Him gifts.

This the type of response we should have even today when we meet Jesus in the Eucharist. Though with the eyes of our bodies we see what appears to be only bread, with the eyes of faith we know it to be the very body of our Lord.

We, like the wise men, can show Jesus great reverence when we kneel before His real presence in the Eucharist.

We too can bring Him gifts of praise, worship and thanksgiving. ”My Lord and my God!” John 20:28.
