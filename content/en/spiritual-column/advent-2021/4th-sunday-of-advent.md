### Mary Visits Elizabeth
> “Mary set out and went with Haste.” **Luke 1:39.**

1. On hearing the good News “Your relative Elizabeth has pregnant in Her old age!” **Luke 1:36**.
- Mary, pregnant with Jesus, “Set out and went with haste.” **Luke 1:39** to the home of Elizabeth:-
	- To rejoice with Her. And to praise and thank the Kind Lord with her, for “He has taken away my disgrace of having no children.“ Luke **1:25**.
	- To be with her and help her in the final weeks of her pregnancy.

2. ”At the sound of Mary’s greeting, Elizabeth’s child leaped within Her, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.” **Luke 1:41**.
- The unborn John the Baptist jumped with Joy on meeting the unborn Messiah.
- Elizabeth inspired by the Holy Spirit recognizes Her Lord in Mary.

3. Elizabeth is 6 months pregnant when Mary arrives **(Luke 1:36)**, and Mary stays 3 months **(Lk 1:56).**
- We can speculate that Mary stays until the birth of John the Baptist and His circumcision ceremony. And returns home to complete Her own pregnancy.

4. This helping love of Mary overwhelms Elizabeth with gratitude and unworthiness “Why am I so honored, that the mother of my Lord should visit me?” **Luke 1:43.**

5. Whenever we need help, Mary will make haste to visit us. She will bring with Her, Her beloved Son, the Lord Jesus, to see to our care, hope and need.
- In the current Covid-19 pandemic. Like Mary, make haste to phone the lonely. To show care and concern for their wellbeing. And to wish them. “A Joy filled Christmas. And A Happy and Blessed New Year, 2022.”

6. Holy Mary, Mother of God, come to our Aid, make hast to help us. Lay Jesus in the manger of our heart.
