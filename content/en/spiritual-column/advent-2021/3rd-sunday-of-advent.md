### The call to repentance
> “The crowds asked: What should we do?” **Luke 3:10**.

1. John the Baptist was a supremely effective preacher. He preached for action and produced it. All kinds of people go out to hear Him. Soldiers, Tax collectors and others. His preaching is so impressive that “The crowds asked: What should we do?” **Luke 3:1**

2. The responses of John the Baptist are simple and straightforward:-
- People with extra food and possessions are to share with those who have none.
- Tax collectors are to be honest and not collect more money than they are due.
- Soldiers are instructed to be content with their pay and stop extorting money or falsely accusing people.
- Jewish people cannot count on their National Heritage. “We are safe, for we are descendants of Abraham.” Luke 3:8. To ensure the favor of God. Rather, they are to repent and produce good fruit. “He is ready to separate the chaff from the wheat with His winnowing fork.” **Luke 3:17**. “Burning the chaff with never ending fire.

3. “Have mercy on me, O God, because of your unfailing love. Because of your great compassion blot out the stain of my sins.” **Psalm 51:1**. “Create in me a clean heart, O God. Renew a loyal Spirit within Me.” **Psalm 51:10**.
