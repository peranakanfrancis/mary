## “But if you say so, I will let the nets down again.” **(Luke 5:5)**

1. Jesus said to Simon: “Now go out where it is deeper, and let down your nets to catch some fish.”

“Master”, Simon replied, “We worked hard all last night and did not catch a thing. But if you say so, I will let the nets down again” and this time their nets were so full of fish, they began to tear! **(Luke 5:4-6)**

2. Tired as he was, Simon was prepared to try again. “But if you say so, I will let the nets down again.” **(Luke 5:5)** and it resulted in a catch of a life time. “And this time their nets were so full of fish, they began to tear! **(Luke 5:6)**

3. For most people the disaster of life is that they give up one effort too soon.

4. There will be ample opportunity in the New Year of Tiger. If we obey the command of the Lord Jesus Christ. “Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch.” **(Luke 5:4)**

Even obstacle will turn into opportunity. For positive thinking will discern a potential opportunity in every obstacle.
