## “They intended to push Jesus over the cliff.” (Luke 4:29) to kill him.

### 1. The people in the synagogue were furious.
Jumping up, they mobbed him and forced him to the edge of the hill on which the town was built. They intended to push him over the cliff. But he passed right through the crowd and went on his way. **(Luke 4:28-30)**.

Anger blinded the furious people. So quietly, going the opposite direction, Jesus passed right through the crowd **(Luke 4:29)** unharmed and untouched and went on his way.

### 2. When we are furious, our anger blinds us.
So, whenever we are furious, do not say anything. Do not do anything. Do not make any decision. If we do, we will regret.
