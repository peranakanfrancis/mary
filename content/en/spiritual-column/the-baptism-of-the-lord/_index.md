> “When Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heaven was opened, and the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven, “You are my Son, the beloved, with you I am well pleased.” Luke 3:21-22.

### 1. Jesus was praying, after He had been baptized.
- God affirms Jesus that Jesus is His beloved Son.
- God assures Jesus that He is pleased with the decision of Jesus to begin His public ministry.
- The Holy Spirit equips Jesus with power for His public ministry.

### 2. Jesus was baptized by water and the Holy Spirit.
   Jesus is the beloved and pleasing Son of God. And equips with power by the Holy Spirit for His public ministry. ßWe too are baptized by water and the Holy Spirit. We too are the beloved and favored Sons and Daughter of God. And we too are equipped with the power by the Holy Spirit.

### 3. As Jesus was praying, the heaven was opened.
   Like Jesus, we need to pray constantly to fan into flame our life giving relationship with God as His beloved and favored Sons and Daughters. And the power and gifts of the Holy Spirit.

> “This is why I remind you to fan into flames the spiritual gift God gave you when I laid my hands on you. For God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.” 2 Timothy 1:6-7.
