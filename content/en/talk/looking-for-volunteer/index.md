An NGO driven Covid Quarantine Centre for B40 Covid Stage 1 & 2 will soon open in Penang Island. Urgently require a Volunteer to be Operations Lead.

This person will lead a small team of volunteers who will work alongside our partner hotel operations team to provide clean sanitized rooms, food distribution, safety and security of patients.

If you have supervisory experience in operations (hotel or factory), willing to work in Red Zone (facing not in direct contact with Covid patients), available 24x7 and would love to serve the needy, then this is a great opportunity. If you are that person then complete the interest form : https://bit.ly/PgPKRCS
