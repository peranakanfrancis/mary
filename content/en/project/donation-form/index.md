**Remarks:**

Our new church project will begin construction work very soon. As we are still short of funds, we will continue to find ways to raise them. Rev Fr Louis will launch the "Brick Donation Campaign" as one of the fundraising events to enable more parishioners to be involved.

From this week onwards, after mass or anytime  during office hours, you can donate RM10 through our Office for a piece of  brick whereby you can write your name on it.

This brick will be used to build the new church. Fr. Louis appeal to all parishioners to contribute and to be involved.
