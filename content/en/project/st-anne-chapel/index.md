These were over 80 Catholic families in Permatang Tinggi New Village during the Emergency. In 1954, Fr. Thomas Chin built a small chapel. As the chapel was too small for the increasing number of parishioners. It was rebuilt into a bigger chapel with the parishioners donations and government fund. The blessing of the New Chapel was officiated by Bishop Gregory Yong on 16 September 1969.

1986, Fr. John Hsiong built a bell tower, the balance of money was used to renovate the altar and purchase of new pews. Annual feast day is on 22 July.
