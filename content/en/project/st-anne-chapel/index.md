The Chapel of St. Anne, Valdor Village dates back to the time of the emergency. A chapel was needed for the
parishioners to participate in the parish life. Fr. Anthony Khaw was responsible for constructing this chapel. It started with humble beginnings of a wooden structure on a large plot of land. As time went by, the chapel became too small to cater to the ever increasing number of Catholics. With time, the chapel became old and worn down. Fr. Raphael Kang was instrumental in raising funds to build a new chapel. The present structure is made of concrete.
