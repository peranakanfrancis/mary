### Gospel Reading (Choose either one) :love_letter:
#### **A reading from the letter of St Paul to the Ephesians  (5:16,20-21, 25, 33; 6:1,4)**
> Making the best use of the time, because the days are evil, be filled with the Spirit. Giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ. Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her. Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord.  Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.

The word of the Lord                          

**All:** Thanks be the God

#### **Letter of St Paul to the Colossians (3:12-17 - Sing praises to God with thankfulness in your hearts)**
> Put on then, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, heartfelt compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience, bearing with one another and forgiving one another, if one has a grievance against another; as the Lord has forgiven you, so must you also do. And over all these put on love, that is, the bond of perfection. And let the peace of Christ control your hearts, the peace into which you were also called in one body. And be thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, as in all wisdom you teach and admonish one another, singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God. And whatever you do, in word or in deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.

The word of the Lord                          

**All:** Thanks be the God

#### **Book of Exodus (12:1-5, 14 - The Feast of Passover)**
> The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt: This month will stand at the head of your calendar; you will reckon it the first month of the year. Tell the whole community of Israel: On the tenth of this month every family must procure for itself a lamb, one apiece for each household. If a household is too small for a lamb, it along with its nearest neighbor will procure one, and apportion the lamb’s costYour lamb must be a year-old male and without blemish. You may take it from either the sheep or the goats. in proportion to the number of persons, according to what each household consumes. This day will be a day of remembrance for you, which your future generations will celebrate with pilgrimage to the LORD; you will celebrate it as a statute forever.
