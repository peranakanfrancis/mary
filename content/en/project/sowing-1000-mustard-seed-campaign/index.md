Dear friends, benefactors, brothers and sisters,

Greetings to you. A little info about this appeal for funds. The Church of the Holy Name of Mary was constructed in 1928 and since then, the area administered by the church has seen tremendous increase in the population. The present church is not large enough to cater to this growth. A new church was then proposed. So we started all the works of designing, procuring approval and finally construction work is about to commence.

For the last 3 years, the church has launched a few initiatives to raise the fund to finance this new church. Unfortunately with the Covid-19 pandemic all further efforts to raise funds stopped abruptly. We have managed to raise RM4 million but this amount is enough to cover only 50% of the projected cost which amounts to RM8 million.

We resumed our initiatives to raise more fund to assure the success of the new church project. It is with this intention that I am appealing to all friends, benefactors, brothers and sisters, to invite you to be a partner in this project by pledging RM1000 each. This amount can be paid in one lump sum or up to 20 instalments. (Minimum of RM50 per donation) It is my fervent wish to be able to get 1000 partners in ‘sowing this 1000 mustard seeds”.

You can make your donation via Cash/Cheque/Bank draft/Money Order/Internet banking. Please remember to send a copy of your transfer to our church administrator so that a receipt can be issued to you at the soonest. All the particulars are listed in the attached donation reply slip.
