Dear parishioners & all Malaysians of good will, 

The Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Malaysia and the Caritas diocese offices see the value of having a pool fund to respond swiftly in any emergency, and to accompany our people through relief, rehabilitation and development – to stand again on their feet. 

In order for us to extend our solidary to communities who are in need of such help, we ask your generosity to make a one-off contribution to the Caritas Malaysia Relief Fund Appeal 2023. We hope to raise Ringgit One million to respond to emergency needs.
