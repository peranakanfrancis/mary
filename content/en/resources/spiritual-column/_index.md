### “Men fainting away with Terror and Fear.” Luke 21:26

1. Nationwide unprecedented Covid-19 Devastations.
   - More than 2 million infections, over 25 thousands deaths and more than 1 thousands suicides cases.
   - Economy and livelihood in disaster.
   - No cure available.
   - The Corona Virus is mutating. The Vaccine is approved for emergency use, is produced at an unprecedented short time of a year. Normally it takes years. As such much are still unknown and uncertain pertaining to the duration of effectiveness and long term side effects. This leads to speculations. Resulting in confusions, anxieties and fears.
   - To make the situations worst, the collation government is weak. All these create unprecedented confusions, anxieties, fear and despair.

2. In the midst of all these confusions, anxieties, fears and despair. “Men fainting away with terror and fear.” Luke 21:26. The Gospel reading of today calls us to “Watch out” Luke 21:34 and to “Keep alert at all times. And pray.” Luke 21:36

    - “Watch out” Luke 21:34  The Corona Virus is with us where ever we go. Thus the need to observe the SOP where ever we are. Not to let the Corona Virus catch us unaware, like a trap. After taking all the necessary precautions. God will cover up whatever loopholes, unforeseen or overlook.

    - “Keep alert at all times. And pray.” Luke 21:36
      “God is with us” Matthew 1：23. An ongoing relationship with Jesus is the only way really to face all that is and will take place.

3. “I have told you all this so that you may find peace in me. In this world you will have hardship and sorrow, but be courageous. I have conquered the world.” John 16:33
