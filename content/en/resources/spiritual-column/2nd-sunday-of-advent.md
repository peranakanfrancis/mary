### The beginning of the Ministry of John the Baptist.
> "Prepare the way for the Lord's coming! Clear the road for Him." Luke 3:4.

1. In ancient East, when a King planned to tour a part of His kingdom, he sent a forerunner before Him to tell the people to prepare the roads. John the Baptist regarded Himself as the forerunner.

2. In "The fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius, the Roman Emperor for (AD28-AD29)." Luke 3:9.
"At this time a message from God came to John, the Son of Zechariah, who was living in the wilderness." Luke 3:2. Then John the Baptist went from place to place on both sides of the Jordan River preaching: "Prepare the way for the Lord's coming! Clear the road for Him!" Luke 3:4.

3. But the preparation on which He insisted was a preparation of heart and life. The King is coming. Mend, not your roads, but your lives.
"Do not tear your clothing in your grief, but tear your hearts instead. Return to the Lord your God for He is merciful and compassionate, slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love. He is eager to relent and not punish." Joel 2:13.

Fr. Augustine Wong
