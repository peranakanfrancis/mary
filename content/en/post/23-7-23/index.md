> The passing on of Faith “from generation to generation.” (Luke 1:50).

Timothy, the “beloved and faithful son in the Lord” (1 Corinthians 4:17) of St. Paul, accompanied and assisted St. Paul of his second (Acts 16:1-4, 17:14-15) and third (Acts 20:4) missionary journey.

St. Paul gave credit to Lois, the grandmother of Timothy, and Eunice the mother of Timothy for passing on their genuine faith to Timothy. “I remember your genuine faith, for you share the faith that first filled your Grandmother Lois and your Mother, Eunice, and I know that same faith continues strong in you.” (2 Timothy 1:5).

Today, Grandparents’ Day, with St. Paul, we give thanks, highlight and appreciate the vital role of Grandparents to assist parents to pass on their genuine and strong faith to their Grandchildren.

### Prayer of Thanks
O God, we thank you with all our hearts for our Grandparents.
In assisting parents to pass on their genuine and strong faith to their Grandchildren.
Grant our Grandparents Happy Long Life together.
Having the satisfying joy of seeing their grandchildren’s children. Amen.

“Fathers can give their sons an inheritance of houses and wealth but only the Lord can give an understanding wife.” (Proverbs 19:14).
