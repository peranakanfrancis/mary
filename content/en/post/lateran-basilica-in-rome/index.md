### Gospel
> 13 Since the Passover of the Jews was near, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

> 14 He found in the temple area those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves, as well as the money-changers seated there.

> 15 He made a whip out of cords and drove them all out of the temple area, with the sheep and oxen, and spilled the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables,

> 16 and to those who sold doves he said, "Take these out of here, and stop making my Father's house a marketplace."

> 17 His disciples recalled the words of scripture, "Zeal for your house will consume me."

> 18 At this the Jews answered and said to him, "What sign can you show us for doing this?"

> 19 Jesus answered and said to them, "Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up."

> 20 The Jews said, "This temple has been under construction for forty-six years, and you will raise it up in three days?"

> 21 But he was speaking about the temple of his body.

> 22 Therefore, when he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they came to believe the scripture and the word Jesus had spoken.

### Reflection
Today the Church celebrates the Feast of the Dedication of the Lateran Basilica in Rome.  If you have not been to Rome, it is the City of Churches.  No matter where you go in the city, there is at least one church in the vicinity and at times, there may be several churches in close proximity to one another.   Originally, the Lateran Basilica was dedicated to our Savior Jesus Christ.  However, in later years the church was named in honor of St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist.

This church has a rich history.  Five of the ecumenical councils were held in this Church.  Also, from the 4th to the 14th century, several Popes resided at the Lateran Basilica.  This church often is considered as mother and head of all the churches of the city of Rome.

The Gospel reading chosen for this feast is a sobering one.  Jesus had gone up to Jerusalem to prepare to celebrate the Passover.  As was his custom, he went to the temple.  When he entered the temple area, it was filled with money changers and sellers of oxen, sheep and doves, who would be used for sacrifice.  Jesus was enraged!  He made a whip out of cords, and taking the whip, he drove out the money changers.  Then he forcefully instructed  the vendors who were selling doves: “Take these out of here!  Stop making my Father’s house into a marketplace!”

Churches are all around us.  No matter where we live, most likely there are several churches in the vicinity.  Yet each church, no matter what denomination it is, is a sacred dwelling place for God.  However, churches are not the only place where God dwells.  God also dwells within each one of us.  We are not a “church.”  However, every human being is a sacred vessel, a home for God.  Today I invite you to ponder this reality.  Do you treasure the fact that God dwells within you?  Do you care well for the temple of your body, mind and spirit?

Today thank God for the gift of God’s presence within you and around you.  And today remember: you are “a temple of God.”  If we truly believe this, we may realize that our day is filled with love, generosity  and peace.  Today thank God for sharing his life and love with you and for making you (and every one human person) “a temple of God.”  May we strive to live each day as a temple of God!  If we do so, our lives will change and perhaps the world may change.
