### Gospel
> 29 While still more people gathered in the crowd, he said to them, "This generation is an evil generation; it seeks a sign, but no sign will be given it, except the sign of Jonah.

> 30 Just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will the Son of Man be to this generation.

> 31 At the judgment the queen of the south will rise with the men of this generation and she will condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and there is something greater than Solomon here.

> 32 At the judgment the men of Nineveh will arise with this generation and condemn it, because at the preaching of Jonah they repented, and there is something greater than Jonah here.

### Reflection:
Today Jesus picks up from where he left off in yesterday’s Gospel.  Today Jesus bluntly tells his listeners: “This generation is an evil generation!  The people seek a sign, yet no sign will be given except the sign of Jonah.”  Jesus then likens himself to Jonah.  He says that just as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, he, Jesus, is the sign for this generation.

I suspect that we human beings at times also ask Jesus or God for a sign.  Perhaps we hope Jesus will affirm a decision we are making.  Or we simply would like to receive a sign that Jesus is present with us.  Personally, I always want my sign to be clear and evident!  Yet Jesus tells his listeners that, he, Jesus, will be the sign to the present generation just as Jonas was the sign for the Ninevites.  Is Jesus enough of a sign for us?  Or do we desire something more visible or tangible?  Or will we trust that Jesus is present to us now and every moment of our lives?   Today and always may we believe that Jesus is the sign given to us by God!  And may we trust that Jesus is with us every moment of the day!
