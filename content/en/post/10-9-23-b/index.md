### Dealing with sin
“If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over. But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that ‘every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.’ If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector.

“Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loose in heaven.

“Again, truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. 20 For where two or three gathers in my name, there I am with them.”

### Reflection
Today's gospel explains the need for fraternal correction. A person who commits a sin is a beloved of God because we are all members of the kingdom of god. Any person’s dignity is considered valuable in God's eyes. The first and best way is to approach the person caringly and speak to him/ her with concern and love. As we may be influenced or prejudiced by the wrong, we are better able to care for him/her if we know the person’s situation. In case the person continues in the sin, the second step is to bring the situation to a small group of persons who may be better able to guide him/her and bring to his/her awareness the possibility for change and a correct way of living. If this fails, the third step is to bring the person to the assembly of the church, where he/she can accept the situation and consider the change possible. Only if all these three correcting measures are not acceptable to the erring person can he/she be considered incorrigible. The entire process is not to punish but to correct and for his/her change of heart. Every sinner is welcome in the kingdom of God

### Praying with listening heart
True listening requires us to spiritually see and sense. It mandates that our hearts are as invested in the process as our ears. Maybe prayer doesn’t mean talking to God at all. Maybe it means just listening. Unplugging the TV, turning off the computer,
Quieting the mental chatter and distractions.
Maybe it means listening to the birds
And the insects, the wind in the leaves, the creaking and groaning of the trees,
noticing
Who else is out there, not far away but nearby;
Sitting so still we can hear our heartbeat,
Watch our breath, the gentle whoosh of air,
The funny noises from our own insides,
Marveling at the body we take so much for granted.
Maybe it means listening to our dreams,
Paying more attention to what we really want from life,
And less attention to all the nagging, scolding voices from our past.
Or maybe it’s all about listening to each other,
Not thinking ahead to how we can answer or rebut or parry or advise or admonish,
But actually being present to each other.
Perhaps if we just sit quietly we’ll overhear a peace whispering through the centuries
That’s missing from the clamor of the moment.
Maybe prayer means listening to the silences between the words,
Noticing the negativity of space,
The vast, undifferentiated and nameless wonder
That underlies it all.
Maybe prayer doesn’t mean talking to God at all,
But listening with the heart,
To the angel choirs all around us.
Those who have ears,
Let them hear

YOURS IN CHRIST,
