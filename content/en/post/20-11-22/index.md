### Word of God
> Jesus said, 'Father, forgive them; they do not know what they are doing.' Then they cast lots to share out his clothing. The people stayed there watching. As for the leaders, they jeered at him with the words, 'He saved others, let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.' The soldiers mocked him too, coming up to him, offering him vinegar, and saying, 'If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.' Above him there was an inscription: 'This is the King of the Jews'. One of the criminals hanging there abused him: 'Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us as well.' But the other spoke up and rebuked him. 'Have you no fear of God at all?' he said. 'You got the same sentence as he did, but in our case we deserved it: we are paying for what we did. But this man has done nothing wrong.' Then he said, 'Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.' He answered him, 'In truth I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise.'

### Reflection
In telling the story of the suffering and death of Jesus, the Gospel of  St. Luke emphasizes the compassion and forgiveness of Jesus, even during his greatest suffering. 

As he is nailed to the cross, Jesus forgives those responsible. Jesus said “Father,    
forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing” (Luke 23:34).

Christian forgiveness is an amazing thing. When St. Stephen was being stoned to death he too prayed. “As they stoned him, Stephen prayed, ‘Lord, Jesus, receive my spirit.’ He fell to his knees, shouting, ‘Lord, do not charge them with this sin !’ and with that, he died” (Acts 7:59-60).

There is nothing so lovely and nothing so rare as christian forgiveness.

When the unforgiving spirit is threatening to turn our hearts to bitterness, let us hear again Our Lord asking forgiveness for those who crucified Him and his servant St. Paul, saying to his friends, “Instead, be kind to each other, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, just as God through Christ has forgiven you” (Ephesians 4:32).

While hanging on the cross, Jesus promises paradise to one of the criminals who came to faith in Jesus as his Messiah.

Then, he said, ‘Jesus, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.’
And Jesus replied, “I assure you, today you will be with me in Paradise”. 
(Luke 23:42-43).

This story tells us that it is never too late to turn to Jesus.

So long as a man’s heart beats, the invitation of Christ still stands.
While there is Life there is Hope.
