> “Always be joyful.  Never stop praying. Be thankful in all circumstances, for this is God’s will for you who belong to Christ Jesus.”  1 Thessalonians 5:16-18.

To pray at all times is to “Pray without ceasing.” 1 Thessalonians 5:17. But how do we do that? We do it by keeping an attitude of thanksgiving and total dependence upon God as we go about everyday lives, turning our thoughts toward Him in the midst of doing all the things we have to do.

I believe that God really wants us to live a lifestyle of prayer. And that He wants to help us stop thinking about prayer as an event. And begin to see it as way of life, as an internal activity that permeate everything we do. He wants us to talk to Him and listen to Him continually. To pray our way through every day without hearts connected to His.

### Prayer of Thanks
O God, I am so grateful that you are always available. I can call on you in prayer all throughout the day. And I will never get a “Busy” signal. Help me grow in prayer and let it be one of the greatest enjoyments in my life.

_Fr. Augustine Wong_
