### 1 Thessalonians 5: 16- 18
Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. I’d say we got straight to the point with this one.

### Reflection
To pray without ceasing “means to have our minds always on the things of God, to be in constant communication with Him, so that every moment may be as fruitful as possible. How can we learn to pray without ceasing?” through your times of active prayer, the spirit will begin to cultivate an attitude of unceasing prayer. And this is the will of God in Christ Jesus.

Let us see what does Matthew 14: 24-33 says.  Lord save me (mt 14: 22) the Lord keeps watch over at all times, especially in times of difficulty. In today’s gospel, the disciples are alone in the boat while a storm rages. They are terrified! Jesus comes towards them in the midst of the storm. They think He is a ghost, but He reassures them saying,” Truly, you are the son of God!” Do we panic the moment a crisis hits us? As Jesus reaches out and grabs Peter's hand when he is sinking, the same hand will reach out to us in difficulties and uncertain moments of our life. Let us say,"Lord, increase our faith.”

“Many of us work together, but what builds communion is also the ability to pray together, to listen together to God’s word and to construct relationships that go beyond work and strengthen beneficial relations between us by helping one another.”

“Journeying together “occurs in two deeply interconnected ways. First, we journey together with one another as the people of God. Next, we journey together as the entire human family. These two perspectives enrich one another and are helpful for our common discernment towards deeper communion and more fruitful missions.

YOURS IN CHRIST,
_REV.SR.JESSICCA LSP, (LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR)_
