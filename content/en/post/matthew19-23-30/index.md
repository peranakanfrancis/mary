### Gospel
> 23 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Amen, I say to you, it will be hard for one who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven.

> 24 Again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for one who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."

> 25 When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and said, "Who then can be saved?"

> 26 Jesus looked at them and said, "For human beings this is impossible, but for God all things are possible."

> 27 Then Peter said to him in reply, "We have given up everything and followed you. What will there be for us?"

> 28 Jesus said to them, "Amen, I say to you that you who have followed me, in the new age, when the Son of Man is seated on his throne of glory, will yourselves sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

> 29 And everyone who has given up houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for the sake of my name will receive a hundred times more, and will inherit eternal life.

> 30 But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.

### Reflection
Today Jesus tells his disciples that it is easier for a “camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God.” For many of us, this statement of Jesus sounds strange. Jesus was speaking of the narrow and low gates of the city walls which were used by travelers after dark when the public gate was locked. A normal sized person had to lower himself to enter through this gate. A camel literally had to kneel and crawl through the gate.

When Jesus uses this analogy of “a camel passing through the eye of a needle,” his listeners immediately would understand what Jesus was implying. They knew that it would be absolutely impossible for any camel to pass through the eye of a needle. Or if a camel tried to pass through a city gate that had been closed for the night, the camel would not be able to do so. The closed passage would be too narrow.

Why was Jesus so cautious about wealth? Wealth can bring many blessings and many challenges. Wealth also may create a sense of false security. Our wealth may enable us to lord it over others or to think we are better than others. Wealth has the potential to be an obstacle for having a true understanding of where the true riches in our lives lie: the individuals we love, joy, peace, our faith, God’s love and care for us and our relationship with God.

When we are comfortable and happy, God may get relegated to the background of our lives rather than the foreground. Some of us may turn to God only when we are in need. Ask yourself: when life is more positive and happy for you, do you give God the same amount of your time and attention? Do you thank God for your many blessings? Or does God seem to recede into the background?

Today ask yourself: what is the wealth in your life? And more importantly: who is the wealth in your life? Who and what are your riches? Take time to thank God for abundance of wealth in your life (even if you struggle with finances). Name and give thanks for the people who en-“rich” your life with their presence, care and love. Give thanks for the beauty of this planet, for laughter, for children, flowers and anything else that brings you joy, peace or pleasure. You (and I) are rich! Do we take this “richness,” this “wealth” for granted? I hope not!
