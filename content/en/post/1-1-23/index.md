### :love_letter: Gospel
> Now it happened that he was in a certain place praying, and when he had finished, one of his disciples said, 'Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.'

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
“Once Jesus was in a certain place praying. As he finished, one of his disciples came to Him and said, “Lord, teach us to pray.”” (Luke 11:1)

The disciples were watching Jesus praying, “and as He was praying, the appearance of His face was transformed.” (Luke 9:29).

Wanting to experience what Jesus experienced, one of His disciples came to Him and said “Lord, teach us to pray.” (Luke 11:1).

The Holy Spirit is calling you and me in 2023 to a deeper and wider experience of the saving and transforming power of prayer.

To make 2023 a wonderful New Year of graces and thanksgiving, living a new “Rich and Satisfying Life”. (John 10:10). Singing a new song of excitements and thankfulness.

“Sing a new song to the Lord for he has done wonderful deeds” in 2023 (Psalm 98:1).
