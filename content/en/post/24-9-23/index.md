“Come quickly, Lord, and answer me,
For my depression deepens,
Do not turn away from me,
Or I will Die.

Let me hear of your unfailing love each morning.
For I am trusting you.
Show me where to walk,
For I give myself to you.

Rescue me from my enemies, Lord.
I run to you to hide me.

Teach me to do your will,
For you are my God.
May your gracious spirit lead me forward on firm footing.

For the glory of your name, 
O Lord, preserve my life.
Because of your faithfulness
Bring me out of this distress.” (Psalm 143: 7-11).
