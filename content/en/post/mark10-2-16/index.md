### Gospel
>  2 The Pharisees approached and asked, "Is it lawful for a husband to divorce his wife?" They were testing him.

> 3 He said to them in reply, "What did Moses command you?"

> 4 They replied, "Moses permitted him to write a bill of divorce and dismiss her."

> 5 But Jesus told them, "Because of the hardness of your hearts he wrote you this commandment.

> 6 But from the beginning of creation, 'God made them male and female.

> 7 For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother (and be joined to his wife),

> 8 and the two shall become one flesh.' So they are no longer two but one flesh.

> 9 Therefore what God has joined together, no human being must separate."

> 10 In the house the disciples again questioned him about this.

> 11 He said to them, "Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her;

> 12 and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery."

> 13 And people were bringing children to him that he might touch them, but the disciples rebuked them.

> 14 When Jesus saw this he became indignant and said to them, "Let the children come to me; do not prevent them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.

> 15 Amen, I say to you, whoever does not accept the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it."

> 16 Then he embraced them and blessed them, placing his hands on them.

### Reflection
Today the Pharisees once again try to corner Jesus.  They approach him and ask: “Is it lawful for a husband to divorce his wife?”  Jesus responds, but he asks them a question.  He asks: “What did Moses command you?”  They replied: “Moses permitted a husband to write a bill of divorce and dismiss her.”  Jesus bluntly says to the Pharisees: “Moses only wrote the bill of divorce because of the peoples’ stubbornness and hardness of heart.”   Jesus then states: “God made them male and female.  For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh.”

From the beginning of time, relationships have been fragile.  This is especially true in marriage where two individuals live day in and day out with each other.  At times, the hard work a good marriage requires may test the strength and the commitment of the two individuals in the relationship.  The current reality is that we live in a “disposable” world.  We use a computer for a time.  Then a new model comes out and we buy the new one.  The old computer may be handed down or sit in the garage.  We drive our car for 100,000 miles but then we trade it in for a newer model.

All relationships require a great deal of work, be that work relationships, friends or family.  However, with work and friends we do not commit ourselves to that individual for life.  It seems that in today’s world, relationships are considered disposable.  Yet, there are instances when the healthiest choice for a spouse or a family would  be divorce.  Most likely this was also true in Jesus’ day.  Yet Jesus clearly desires that we give our best and our all to any significant relationship, especially marriage.  

Perhaps Jesus is asking us to make thoughtful and loving choices, discerning choices. Since we live in a disposable world, our instinct is to move on to another relationship or another job.  And this may be the healthiest choice for us.  However, when we commit ourselves to marriage or religious life we promise to work together in good times and in bad.  This may mean counseling, making a marriage encounter, giving our all to see if the marriage can be saved.  Divorce may still be the answer.  However, hopefully it will not be the first answer we consider!
