### :love_letter: Gospel
> Now John had heard in prison what Christ was doing and he sent his disciples to ask him, 'Are you the one who is to come, or are we to expect someone else?' Jesus answered, 'Go back and tell John what you hear and see; the blind see again, and the lame walk, those suffering from virulent skin-diseases are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised to life and the good news is proclaimed to the poor; and blessed is anyone who does not find me a cause of falling.' As the men were leaving, Jesus began to talk to the people about John, 'What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swaying in the breeze? No? Then what did you go out to see? A man wearing fine clothes? Look, those who wear fine clothes are to be found in palaces. Then what did you go out for? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet: he is the one of whom scripture says: Look, I am going to send my messenger in front of you to prepare your way before you. 'In truth I tell you, of all the children born to women, there has never been anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet the least in the kingdom of Heaven is greater than he. Since John the Baptist came, up to this present time, the kingdom of Heaven has been subjected to violence and the violent are taking it by storm.

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
“Go back to John and tell him what you have heard and seen, the Blind see, the Lame walk, the Lepers are cured, the Deaf hear, the Dead are raised to Life and the Good News is being preached to the poor.” (Matthew 11:4-5).

The career of John the Baptist had ended in disaster.

John the Baptist “had been arrested.” (Matthew 4:12). This event prompted Jesus to begin his Ministry (Matthew 4:17). How much time has elapsed between then and the present episode is uncertain, but it was long enough for uncertainty to take hold of the imprisoned prophet.

Whatever thoughts were churning in the mind of John the Baptist, it seems that the works of Jesus did not quite match his expectations.

John the Baptist thus sends disciples to Jesus with the question. “Are you the Messiah we have been expecting or should we keep looking for someone else?” (Matthew 11:3).

The response of Jesus is basically a resume of his achievements up to this point in the story. “Go back to John and tell him what you have heard and seen. The blind see, the lame walk. The lepers are cured. The deaf hear, the dead are raised to Life. And the Good News is being preached to the poor.” (Matthews 11:4-5).

This is an impressive report. It is hard to deny that God has powerfully at work in this Holy Man from Nazareth.

The answer of Jesus to the disciples of John the Baptist was “Go back and do not tell John what I am saying. Tell him what I am doing. Do not tell John what I am claiming. Tell him what is happening.

The challenge of Jesus is still the same. He does not so much say, “Listen to what I have to tell you” and “look what I can do for you. See what I have done for others.”

The things that Jesus did in Galilee he still does.

Those who were blind to the truth about themselves and about God, have their eyes opened.

Those who were deaf to the voice of conscience and of God begin to listen.

Those who were dead and powerless in sin are raised to newness and loveliness of Life.

Those who were paralysed by fear and lie/ falsehood, the lame, walk again.

“Come quickly, Lord, and answer me, for my depression deepens. Do not turn away from me or I will die. Let me hear of Your unfailing love each morning, for I am trusting You. Show me where to walk for I give myself to You. (Psalm 143:7-8).
