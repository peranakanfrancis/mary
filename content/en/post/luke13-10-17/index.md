### Gospel
> 10 He was teaching in a synagogue on the sabbath.

> 11 And a woman was there who for eighteen years had been crippled by a spirit; she was bent over, completely incapable of standing erect.

> 12 When Jesus saw her, he called to her and said, "Woman, you are set free of your infirmity."

> 13 He laid his hands on her, and she at once stood up straight and glorified God.

> 14 But the leader of the synagogue, indignant that Jesus had cured on the sabbath, said to the crowd in reply, "There are six days when work should be done. Come on those days to be cured, not on the sabbath day."

> 15 The Lord said to him in reply, "Hypocrites! Does not each one of you on the sabbath untie his ox or his ass from the manger and lead it out for watering?

> 16 This daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound for eighteen years now, ought she not to have been set free on the sabbath day from this bondage?"

> 17 When he said this, all his adversaries were humiliated; and the whole crowd rejoiced at all the splendid deeds done by him.

### Reflection:
As Jesus was teaching in the synagogue on the Sabbath, he noticed a woman who was there.  For eighteen years, this woman had been crippled by a spirit.  She was completely bent over and unable to stand erect.  Imagine: for eighteen long years, all this woman could see was the ground and the legs and feet of the people who passed her by.  Her world was horribly small and limited.  The little children must have been a gift to her.  At least, they were in her “sight range.”

Luke writes: “When Jesus saw the woman he called to her and said: ‘Woman, you are set free of your infirmity.’”  Then he laid his hands on her and immediately she stood up straight.  The woman began praising and glorifying God for the wondrous gift Jesus had given her.

However, the leader of the synagogue was indignant that Jesus had healed on the Sabbath.  The leader said to the people: “There are six days when work can be done.  Come on those days to be healed, not on the Sabbath.”  Jesus angrily replied: “Hypocrites!  Do you not untie your ox or ass on the Sabbath and water it?  Yet this woman has been bound for eighteen years!  Ought she not be freed from this bondage simply because it is the Sabbath?  Luke then writes: “All of his adversaries were humiliated.  And the whole crowd rejoiced at the splendid deeds done by Jesus.”

What has “crippled” your spirit?  Is it an illness?  A family situation or stress at work?  Is it  financial stress?  Today bring your “life challenge” to Jesus.  Stand before him.  Trust him to heal you just as he healed this woman.  It may not be an immediate healing but slowly and surely he will heal your spirit and your life!  He will not fail you!  ﻿
