Advent must be a time when we ponder the truth that God came to earth to give us himself in an unmerited and freeway. His life is a totally free gift to us and his greatest gift we received. In turn, Advent must be a time when we also reflect upon our calling to bring the gift of Christ Jesus to others.
Today upon the giving and receiving of Jesus in your life. Let your heart be filled with gratitude for this advent so that you, in turn, can give the gift of Jesus to others.

### Reflection
Two activities are difficult for human beings; one is waiting, and the other is keeping awake. And these activities are boring when the arrival of an expected person is uncertain. Time and again Jesus stresses these two activities. Through the parable of the foolish virgins He tells us that we will lose the opportunity of being with the bridegroom if we fail to wait and keep awake. Waiting is a motionless activity, but there is a joy in waiting and, as the English poet John Milton said,” They also serve those who only stand and wait”. Patience is key to waiting or keeping awake. Impatience can lead to boredom and sleepiness. Jesus is telling his listeners to expect the unexpected to happen. Am I ready for the unexpected arrival of Jesus this advent?

“Be on your guard, stay awake, because you never know when the time will come” (Mark 13: 33)
