### Gospel
> Jesus went around to all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and curing every disease and illness. At the sight of the crowds, his heart was moved with pity for them because they were troubled and abandoned, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is abundant but the laborers are few; so ask the master of the harvest to send out laborers for his harvest.” Then he summoned his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits to drive them out and to cure every disease and every illness. Jesus sent out these twelve after instructing them thus, “Do not go into pagan territory or enter a Samaritan town. Go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. As you go, make this proclamation: ‘The kingdom of heaven is at hand.’ Cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, drive out demons. Without cost you have received; without cost you are to give.

### Reflection
What is it that we have received “without cost?”  Well, we have received every good thing for free.  It’s true!  All that is good is a gift from God.  And it’s a free gift from Him.  There is nothing we can do to earn His blessings in our lives.  Do you believe that?

The above Scripture quote is part of Jesus’ exhortation to His Twelve Apostles as He sends them out to preach, heal and cast out demons in His name.  He reminds them that all they have received from Him is a free gift and that they must, in turn, give the Gospel free of charge to everyone.

Advent is a time when we should especially focus upon the coming celebration of the Gift of Christmas.  Christmas is a time when we give and receive gifts, but it’s important to understand the difference between a “gift” and a “present.”  A present is something that is expected.  For example, your spouse or child expects a present on their birthday or on Christmas.  But a gift is something that is much more.  A gift is something that is freely given, unearned and undeserved.  It’s given out of love with no strings attached.  This is what the Incarnation is all about.

Advent must be a time when we ponder the truth that God came to Earth to give us Himself in an unmerited and free way.  His life is a totally free Gift to us and is the greatest Gift we have ever received.  In turn, Advent must be a time when we also reflect upon our calling to bring the Gift of Christ Jesus to others.  

### Meditation
Reflect, today, upon the giving and receiving of Jesus in your life.  Let your heart be filled with gratitude this Advent so that you, in turn, can give the Gift of Jesus to others.

### Prayer
Lord, thank You for the Gift of Your life. Thank You for coming to Earth to enter into my life.  Thank You for the joy of knowing You and loving You. May I allow this joy to so transform my life that I may continually seek to give You to others. Jesus, I trust in You.
