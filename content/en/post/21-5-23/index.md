> I no longer call you servants, because a master does not confide in his servants. Now you are my friends, since I have told you everything the Father told me. (John 15:15).

One of the most important keys to effective prayer is approaching the Lord Jesus Christ as his friend. When we go to the Lord Jesus Christ believing that he sees us as his friends, new wonders are opened to us. We experience new freedom and boldness, which are both things to be extremely grateful for.

If we do not know the Lord Jesus Christ as a friend, we will reluctant to be bold in asking for what we need. But if we go to the Lord Jesus Christ as our friend, without losing our awe of Him, our prayers will stay fresh, exciting and intimate.

A friendship involves loving and being loved. It means knowing that the Lord Jesus Christ is on your side, wanting to help you, cheering you on, and always keeping your best interest in mind. The Lord Jesus Christ loves you and desires your friendship.

### PRAYER OF THANKS
Lord Jesus Christ.
I am thankful that you have promised to be my friend.
Help me to come to you in prayer.
Knowing that you love me and you are for me.
Thank you, Lord Jesus Christ, that I am never alone.
You are my Friend and you are with me.
