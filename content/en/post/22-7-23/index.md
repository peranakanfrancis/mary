> who sowed good seed in his field. But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared. “The owner’s servants came to him and said, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where did the weeds come from?’ “‘An enemy did this,’ he replied. “The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and pull them up?’ “‘No,’ he answered, ‘because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time, I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.’”

### Reflection
Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.”

He answered, “The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.  The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the people of the kingdom. The weeds are the people of the evil one and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.

“As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age.  The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears, let them hear.

The good that exists in the world is overshadowed by human sinfulness and wickedness. Many times, we think; why doesn’t God destroy all that evil in the world. One who destroys what He has created is an abominable being. The creator, rather, loves the imperfections of His creation together with their good deeds. It would be too hasty for God to destroy what He does not like. He would be a God who does not allow His children to grow and learn to be better. The logic of God seems to be “I do not take away the evil from you, but I am next to you; I give you the strength to overcome the evil, so that you come out stronger.” Jesus is like the yeast that allows one to grow together with one’s strengths and weaknesses. He helps the person by accompanying him/her to pass through obstacles so as to become free by reaching the desired destination: __Relationship with GOD__.

Yours in Christ,
