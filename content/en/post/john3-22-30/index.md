### :love_letter: Gospel (John 3:22-30)
> After this, Jesus and his disciples went into the region of Judea, where he spent some time with them baptizing. John was also baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was an abundance of water there, and people came to be baptized, for John had not yet been imprisoned.

> Now a dispute arose between the disciples of John and a Jew about ceremonial washings. So they came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, the one who was with you across the Jordan, to whom you testified, here he is baptizing and everyone is coming to him.”

> John answered and said, “No one can receive anything except what has been given him from heaven. You yourselves can testify that I said [that] I am not the Messiah, but that I was sent before him.

> The one who has the bride is the bridegroom; the best man,* who stands and listens to him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom’s voice. So this joy of mine has been made complete. He must increase; I must decrease.”

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
These powerful and prophetic words of St. John the Baptist should echo in our hearts every day.  They help set the tone for all that we are and who we must become.  What do these words mean?  Clearly, there are two things that John says here:
1. Jesus must increase
2. We must decrease.

First of all, Jesus increasing in our lives is the primary goal we must have.  What exactly does this mean?  It means that He takes greater possession of our mind and will.  It means He possesses us and we possess Him.  It means that our number one goal and desire in life is the fulfillment of His holy will in all things.  It means that fear is cast aside and charity becomes our reason for living.  It’s very freeing to allow the Lord to increase in our lives.  It’s freeing in the sense that we no longer have to try and manage on our own.  Jesus now lives in and through us.

Second, when John says that he must decrease, he means that his own will, desires, ambitions, hopes, etc., must dissolve as Jesus takes over.  It means that all selfishness must be abandoned and selfless living must be the founding principle of our lives.  To “decrease” before God means we become humble.  Humility is a way of giving up everything not of God and allowing only God to shine through.

### :latin_cross: Meditation
Reflect, today, upon this beautiful statement of St. John the Baptist.  Make it a prayer and say it over and over.  Let it become the guiding principle of your life.

### :pray: Prayer
Lord, You must increase and I must decrease.  Please come and take complete possession of my soul.  Transform my mind and heart, guide my will, emotions and desires.  And allow me to become a holy instrument of Your divine life.  Jesus, I trust in You.
