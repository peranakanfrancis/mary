### :love_letter: Gospel
> When Jesus had crossed again [in the boat] to the other side, a large crowd gathered around him, and he stayed close to the sea. One of the synagogue officials, named Jairus, came forward. Seeing him he fell at his feet and pleaded earnestly with him, saying, “My daughter is at the point of death. Please, come lay your hands on her that she may get well and live.” He went off with him, and a large crowd followed him and pressed upon him.

> There was a woman afflicted with hemorrhages for twelve years. She had suffered greatly at the hands of many doctors and had spent all that she had. Yet she was not helped but only grew worse. She had heard about Jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak. She said, “If I but touch his clothes, I shall be cured.” Immediately her flow of blood dried up. She felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.

> Jesus, aware at once that power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd and asked, “Who has touched my clothes?” But his disciples said to him, “You see how the crowd is pressing upon you, and yet you ask, ‘Who touched me?’” And he looked around to see who had done it.

> The woman, realizing what had happened to her, approached in fear and trembling. She fell down before Jesus and told him the whole truth. He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has saved you. Go in peace and be cured of your affliction.”
> While he was still speaking, people from the synagogue official’s house arrived and said, “Your daughter has died; why trouble the teacher any longer?” Disregarding the message that was reported, Jesus said to the synagogue official, “Do not be afraid; just have faith.” He did not allow anyone to accompany him inside except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.

> When they arrived at the house of the synagogue official, he caught sight of a commotion, people weeping and wailing loudly. So he went in and said to them, “Why this commotion and weeping? The child is not dead but asleep.” And they ridiculed him. Then he put them all out. He took along the child’s father and mother and those who were with him and entered the room where the child was.

> He took the child by the hand and said to her, “Talitha koum,” which means, “Little girl, I say to you, arise!” The girl, a child of twelve, arose immediately and walked around. [At that] they were utterly astounded. He gave strict orders that no one should know this and said that she should be given something to eat.

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
These are the thoughts and experience of the woman who had suffered greatly for twelve years with hemorrhages.  She sought out many doctors and had spent all she had in an attempt to be healed.  Sadly, nothing worked.

It’s possible that God permitted her suffering to continue all those years so that she would be given this particular opportunity to manifest her faith for all to see.  It’s interesting that this passage actually reveals her interior thinking as she approaches Jesus.  “If I but touch his clothes…”  This interior thinking is a beautiful illustration of faith.

How would she have known that she would be healed?  What was it that led her to believe this with such clarity and conviction?  Why, after spending twelve years working with every doctor she could come by, would she suddenly realize that all she needed to do is to touch Jesus’ clothes in order to be healed?  The answer is simple.  Because she was given the gift of faith.

This illustration of her faith reveals that faith is a supernatural knowledge of something that only God can reveal.  In other words, she knew she would be healed, and her knowledge of this healing came to her as a gift imparted by God.  Once imparted, she had to act on this knowledge and, in so doing, she gave a wonderful witness to all who would read her story.

Her life, and in particular this experience, should challenge us all to realize that God also speaks profound truths to us, if we only listen.  He is constantly speaking and revealing the depth of His love to us, calling us to enter into a life of manifest faith.  He wants our own faith to not only be the foundation of our lives, but also to be a powerful witness to others.  

### :latin_cross: Meditation
Reflect, today, upon the interior conviction of faith that this woman had.  She knew God would heal her because she allowed herself to hear Him speak.  Reflect upon your own interior attentiveness to the voice of God and try to be open to the same depth of faith witnessed by this holy woman.

### :pray: Prayer
My compassionate Lord, I love You and I desire to know You and to hear You speak to me each and every day.  Please increase my faith so that I may know You and Your will for my life.  Please use me as You wish to be a witness of faith for others.  Jesus, I trust in You.
