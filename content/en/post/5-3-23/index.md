### Gospel
Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led them up a high mountain by themselves. There in their presence he was transfigured: his face shone like the sun and his clothes became as dazzling as light. And suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared to them; they were talking with him. Then Peter spoke to Jesus. 'Lord,' he said, 'it is wonderful for us to be here; if you want me to, I will make three shelters here, one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.' He was still speaking when suddenly a bright cloud covered them with shadow, and suddenly from the cloud there came a voice which said, 'This is my Son, the Beloved; he enjoys my favour. Listen to him.' When they heard this, the disciples fell on their faces, overcome with fear. But Jesus came up and touched them, saying, 'Stand up, do not be afraid.'And when they raised their eyes they saw no one but Jesus.As they came down from the mountain Jesus gave them this order, 'Tell no one about this vision until the Son of man has risen from the dead.'

### Reflection
Peter, James and John must have felt that way when they saw Jesus in his Glory talking with Moses and Elijah on the mountain top. Peter wanted to stay up on the mountain, but it quickly became clear that he could not do so.  

Faith has its high moments as well as its low moments. It is unrealistic to think that we can maintain some kind of Spiritual high all the time. Doing so may even be dangerous.
The faith of those who depend on mountain top experience often fizzles out. The better challenge is to learn what it means to live as a Christian down in the thick of life.

Though profound religious experiences enliven our faith, listening and following the words of Jesus daily are what really fortify our faith and give us a new life.

“This is my dearly loved Son, who brings me great Joy. Listen to Him.” (Matthew 17:5).
