“For we died and were buried with Christ by Baptism. And just as Christ has raised from the dead by the glorious power of the Father, now we also may live new lives.” (Romans 6:4)

There is a popular hymn titled “Because He lives,” and it is about the fact that Jesus’ Death and Resurrection give us the power and privilege to live life today in victory. Because He lives we can face whatever comes our way, knowing that God will never allow us to go through more than we can bear, and that he always provides a way out.

Because Jesus lives, we can also have a new attitude toward ourselves. We can stop expecting ourselves to be perfect and learn to enjoy ourselves even in the midst of making mistakes, Jesus died for our mistakes and is alive today to help us grow in Him and be changed by His Word and Holy Spirit.

Be grateful for the sacrifice of Jesus, and get a new attitude about yourself! Stop thinking that your failures and mistakes are too much for God. He has cast all of your sins behind his back. (See Isaiah 38:17). He is not looking at them, so you do not need to look at them either!

### Prayer of Thanks
Almighty and merciful God, I thank you, that Jesus is alive, and that the same spirit who raised Him from the dead dwells in me.

Help me face every challenges in life boldly, put my guilt and sins behind me and embrace your mercy and forgiveness.
