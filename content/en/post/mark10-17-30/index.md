### Gospel
> 17 As he was setting out on a journey, a man ran up, knelt down before him, and asked him, "Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"

> 18 Jesus answered him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone.

> 19 You know the commandments: 'You shall not kill; you shall not commit adultery; you shall not steal; you shall not bear false witness; you shall not defraud; honor your father and your mother.'"

> 20 He replied and said to him, "Teacher, all of these I have observed from my youth."

> 21 Jesus, looking at him, loved him and said to him, "You are lacking in one thing. Go, sell what you have, and give to (the) poor and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me."

> 22 At that statement his face fell, and he went away sad, for he had many possessions.

> 23 Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!"

> 24 The disciples were amazed at his words. So Jesus again said to them in reply, "Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!

> 25 It is easier for a camel to pass through (the) eye of (a) needle than for one who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."

> 26 They were exceedingly astonished and said among themselves, "Then who can be saved?"

> 27 Jesus looked at them and said, "For human beings it is impossible, but not for God. All things are possible for God."

> 28 Peter began to say to him, "We have given up everything and followed you."

> 29 Jesus said, "Amen, I say to you, there is no one who has given up house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands for my sake and for the sake of the gospel

> 30 who will not receive a hundred times more now in this present age: houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and eternal life in the age to come.

### Reflection
In this Gospel, we hear the story of the rich young man who came to Jesus and asked him: “What must I do to inherit eternal life?”  Instead of answering the man’s question, Jesus asks him: “Why do you call me good?  No one is good but God alone.”  Jesus then names several of the commandments.   After Jesus had finished speaking, the young man told Jesus: “I have observed these commandments since I was young.”  Mark writes: “Jesus, looking at the man, loved him.”  Jesus then said to the man: “You are lacking one thing.  Go, sell all you have and give the money to the poor.  Then, come and follow me.”  When the young man realized what Jesus was asking of him, Mark writes: “At Jesus’ statement, the man’s face fell, and he went away sad for he had many possessions.”

Now ask yourself: How would you (and I) respond if Jesus looked at us and asked us to sell everything we have, give our money to the poor and then leave home and follow him?  Would we truly be willing to “give our all?”  Or would we respond as the rich young man did?  Would we also walk away from Jesus, sad and troubled?  Possessions and wealth have a dangerous potential to possess us if we are not careful and mindful.  Every ad we hear on TV and the radio encourages us to buy, buy, buy!  For many people in the first world countries the slogan “more is better” is lived out every day!

Yet Jesus clearly understands that our “need” for more possessions or upgraded possessions may begin to “possess” us!  If you ever go to a mall the day after Christmas, you see people buying items that are a great bargain.  However, do they truly need those bargains?  Or do they buy the item simply because it is a bargain?  I confess that at times, I am one of those shoppers.  However on these occasions do we buy only what we truly need?

If we are not mindful, our possessions may begin to “possess” us.  Today Jesus warns his disciples (us) to be mindful and aware!  Jesus wants us to be completely free to follow him.  The question is: are we willing to give up all we have and follow Jesus?  What is your (and my) answer?
