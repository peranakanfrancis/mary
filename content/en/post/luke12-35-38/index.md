### Gospel
> 35 "Gird your loins and light your lamps

> 36 and be like servants who await their master's return from a wedding, ready to open immediately when he comes and knocks.

> 37 Blessed are those servants whom the master finds vigilant on his arrival. Amen, I say to you, he will gird himself, have them recline at table, and proceed to wait on them.

> 38 And should he come in the second or third watch and find them prepared in this way, blessed are those servants.

### Reflection:
This Gospel begins as Jesus says to the disciples: “Gird your loins and light your lamps and be like servants who await their master’s return from a wedding.  Be ready to open the gate when he comes and knocks.”  Jesus then adds: “Blessed are the servants whom the master finds waiting for him on his arrival.”  Take a moment and ask yourself: Are my loins girt?  Is my lamp lit?  Am I waiting for my master’s arrival today?

Today Jesus will come to you (and to me)!  The question for us is: will we patiently wait for Him?  Will we be watchful and awake to his coming?  Or will we become drowsy, lethargic and fall asleep?  If we are alert and awake, Jesus not only will come to us, He will serve us at table.  And we will receive the great gift of his presence and love!

Today, be alert!  Gird your loins!  Light the lamp of your heart!  Await his coming!  Jesus will not disappoint you!  You will receive the gift and pleasure of his company!  What more could we ask for?
