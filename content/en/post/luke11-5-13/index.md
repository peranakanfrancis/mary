### Gospel
> 5 And he said to them, "Suppose one of you has a friend to whom he goes at midnight and says, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,

> 6 for a friend of mine has arrived at my house from a journey and I have nothing to offer him,'

> 7 and he says in reply from within, 'Do not bother me; the door has already been locked and my children and I are already in bed. I cannot get up to give you anything.'

> 8 I tell you, if he does not get up to give him the loaves because of their friendship, he will get up to give him whatever he needs because of his persistence.

> 9 "And I tell you, ask and you will receive; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.

> 10 For everyone who asks, receives; and the one who seeks, finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.

> 11 What father among you would hand his son a snake when he asks for a fish?

> 12 Or hand him a scorpion when he asks for an egg?

> 13 If you then, who are wicked, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the Father in heaven give the holy Spirit to those who ask him?"

### Reflection:
Today’s Gospel begins with Jesus asking his disciples what they would do if a friend woke them out of a deep sleep in the middle of the night and asked them for a loaf of bread. Honestly, ask yourself: how would you respond? If the friend continues to persist, most likely we will give them what they want so we can have some peace!

Jesus talks about this scenario but then moves into a passage that is very familiar: “Ask and you will receive, seek and you will find, knock and the door will be opened.” Ask yourself: do you take Jesus’s words literally?

I assume that most of us have learned over the years not to take Jesus’s words literally. At times in my life, I know that Jesus has answered my prayer. However, there have been other times when I believe that my prayer has not been answered — at least in the way I wanted it to be answered. Are my expectations too concrete? Is it realistic for me to expect to receive exactly what I asked for since it doesn’t usually happen that way? However, does this mean that my asking, seeking and knocking are in vain? Does this mean that Jesus is not listening to me?

I strive to trust and believe that Jesus does respond to me. However, I don’t always recognize his response at the time. Other times I may be so upset about not getting the answer I “wanted” that I don’t have the openness to recognize the answer I receive!

Today may we pray for open eyes, open minds and open hearts to hear, for Jesus may be answering us! We may receive more than we asked for!
