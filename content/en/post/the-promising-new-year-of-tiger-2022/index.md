When He had finished speaking, He said to Simon: “Now go out where it is deeper, and let down your nets to catch some fish.” “Master”, Simon replied: “We worked hard all last night and did not catch a thing. But if you say so, I will let the nets down again. And this time their nets were so full of fish they began to tear!” **(Luke 5:4-6)**.

1. At the beginning of spring, the sight of nature bouncing back to life. Little green shoots started to appear. Fruit trees are covered with buds, filled us with joy and hope. Likewise at the beginning of the new spring festival, the New Year of the Tiger, we are filled with joy, hope and thankfulness for the new opportunities for employments and business ventures.

2. So, the Lord Jesus command us, “Now go out where it is deeper and let down your nets to catch some fish.” **(Luke 5:4)** This command of the Lord Jesus has two implications.
- Whatever you do, do not give up. “But if you say so, I will let the nets down again.” **(Luke 5:5)**.
Your breakthrough, success, is on the way. Be grateful. God has heard your prayers.
- With positive minds and cheerful hearts, look out and recognise the employments and business ventures God has planned for you. “Now go out where it is deeper and let down your nets to catch some fish.” **(Luke  5:4)** God has heard your prayers. Be thankful.

3. Obedience to the command of the Lord Jesus, “Now go out where it is deeper, and let down your nets where it is deeper, and let down your nets to catch some fish.” **(Luke 5:4)**, will result in the catch of a lifetime. “And this time their nets were so full of fish, they began to tear!” **(Luke 5:6)**

4. Live each day with a thankful heart, grateful for every good thing, no matter how big or how small, that God has done in your life.

As you begin to remember the good things God has done in your past and realise the blessings you have in the present, you cannot help getting excited about he is going to do for you in the New Year of the Tiger. Be thankful and be ready. God has something amazing in store for you in the New Year.

Wishing you a wonderful Happy New Year. Holy Mary, mother of God and good St. Joseph watch over us in the new Year of the Tiger.

“May the Lord bless you and protect you. May the Lord smile on you and be gracious to you. May the Lord show you his favour and give you his peace”. **(Numbers 6: 24-26)**.

> “Be strong and very courageous. Then you will be successful in everything you do.”
**(Joshua 1:7)**.
