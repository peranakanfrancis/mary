### :love_letter: Gospel
> He said to them, “Today this scripture passage is fulfilled in your hearing.” And all spoke highly of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his mouth. They also asked, “Isn’t this the son of Joseph?”

> He said to them, “Surely you will quote me this proverb, ‘Physician, cure yourself,’ and say, ‘Do here in your native place the things that we heard were done in Capernaum.’”

> And he said, “Amen, I say to you, no prophet is accepted in his own native place. Indeed, I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah when the sky was closed for three and a half years and a severe famine spread over the entire land. It was to none of these that Elijah was sent, but only to a widow in Zarephath in the land of Sidon.

> Again, there were many lepers in Israel during the time of Elisha the prophet; yet not one of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.” When the people in the synagogue heard this, they were all filled with fury.

> They rose up, drove him out of the town, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their town had been built, to hurl him down headlong. But he passed through the midst of them and went away.

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
Sharing the Gospel with your family is not always as easy as sharing it with a stranger.  Conversely, listening to the Gospel message from a family member is not always as easy as hearing it from someone else.  Why is that?  

It may be that familiarity with another, such as the familiarity we have with family members, can tempt us to lack a certain confidence in their convictions and in their Christian witness.  Though this is certainly not true of every relationship we have, it can be the case with some.  Children, at times, will not put as much confidence in the words of a parent as they may another.  Siblings may not be as open to advice from each other as they are from other people.  

Perhaps one of the reasons for this experience is that we are often far more critical of those we know well than those we do not know.  It’s easy to allow our long history of personal experience to hinder our openness toward family members.  This is especially the case with the negative experiences we have had over the years.  So often, we hold onto negative experiences and hurts from year to year and we allow those experiences to become a filter for anything that a family member says or does.

This statement from Jesus, that “no prophet is accepted in his own native place,” should challenge us to make sure we do not fall into this tendency.  We should do what we can to make sure that we do accept the prophetic witness shared with us from our own family members.  

The best way to do this is to make sure that we regularly strive to purge any “baggage” we carry in those relationships.  Very often, we carry the baggage of hurt, anger and resentment without even realizing it.  We also easily focus in on the weaknesses of family members since we easily witness their weaknesses as a result of being close to them.  

### :latin_cross: Meditation
Reflect, today, upon your family.  Reflect, especially, upon whether you allow yourself to look beyond their weaknesses and sins so as to see the goodness of God at work in their lives.  There is much that God wants to say to you through them.  Make sure you have not closed that door and are willing to accept them as a messenger of the Gospel.

### :pray: Prayer
Dearest Lord, I thank You for my family.  I thank You for the gift that they have been in my life.  Help me to daily show mercy and forgiveness to them as needed.  Help me to daily be open to Your voice speaking through them.  Jesus, I trust in You.
