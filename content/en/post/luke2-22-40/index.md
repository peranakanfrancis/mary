### :love_letter: Gospel
> When the days were completed for their purification according to the law of Moses, they took him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord, just as it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every male that opens the womb shall be consecrated to the Lord,” and to offer the sacrifice of “a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons,” in accordance with the dictate in the law of the Lord.

> Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout, awaiting the consolation of Israel, and the holy Spirit was upon him. It had been revealed to him by the holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Messiah of the Lord.

> He came in the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to perform the custom of the law in regard to him, he took him into his arms and blessed God, saying: “Now, Master, you may let your servant go in peace, according to your word, for my eyes have seen your salvation, which you prepared in sight of all the peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and glory for your people Israel."

> The child’s father and mother were amazed at what was said about him; and Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, “Behold, this child is destined for the fall and rise of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be contradicted (and you yourself a sword will pierce) so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.”

> There was also a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years, having lived seven years with her husband after her marriage, and then as a widow until she was eighty-four. She never left the temple, but worshiped night and day with fasting and prayer. And coming forward at that very time, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were awaiting the redemption of Jerusalem.

> When they had fulfilled all the prescriptions of the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth. The child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom; and the favor of God was upon him.

### :speech_balloon: Reflection:
We celebrate, today, the glorious event of Jesus being presented in the Temple by Mary and Joseph.  Simeon, a “righteous and devout” man, had been waiting for this moment throughout his life.  The passage above is what he spoke when the moment finally arrived.

This is a profound statement that came from a humble and faith-filled heart.  Simeon was saying something like this: “Lord of Heaven and earth, my life is now complete.  I’ve seen Him.  I’ve held Him.  He is the one.  He is the Messiah.  There is nothing more I need in life.  My life is fulfilled.  I am now ready to die.  My life has reached its purpose and culmination.”

Simeon, like any other ordinary human being, would have had many experiences in life.  He would have had many ambitions and goals.  Many things he worked hard for.  So for him to say that he was now ready to “go in peace” simply means that the purpose of his life was fulfilled and that all he has worked for and striven for has come to culmination in this moment.

That’s saying a lot!  But it’s really a great witness for us in our daily lives and gives us an example of what we should strive for.  We see in this experience of Simeon that life must be about encountering Christ and fulfilling our purpose in accord with God’s plan.  For Simeon, that purpose, revealed to him through the gift of his faith, was to receive the Christ Child in the temple at His presentation and to then consecrate this Child to the Father in accordance with the law.  

What is your mission and purpose in life?  It will not be the same as Simeon but it will have similarities.  God has a perfect plan for you that He will reveal to you in faith.  This calling and purpose will ultimately be about you receiving Christ in the temple of your heart and then praising and worshiping Him for all to see.  It will take on a unique form in accord with the will of God for your life.  But it will be as significant and important as Simeon’s calling, and will be integral to the entire divine plan of salvation for the world.  

### :speech_balloon: Meditation
Reflect, today, upon your own calling and mission in life.  Don’t miss your call.  Don’t miss your mission.  Continue to listen, anticipate, and act in faith as that plan unfolds so that you, too, may one day rejoice and “go in peace” confident that this calling has been fulfilled.

### :pray: Prayer
Lord, I am Your servant.  I seek Your will.  Help me to respond to You in faith and openness and help me to say “Yes” to You so that my life will achieve the purpose for which I was made.  I thank You for the witness of Simeon and pray that I, too, will one day rejoice that my life has been fulfilled.  Jesus, I trust in You.
