Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a huge crowd of witnesses to the life of faith, let us strip off every weight that slows us down, especially the sin that so easily trips us up.

And let us run with endurance the race God has set before us.
We do this by keeping our eyes on Jesus, the champion who initiates and perfects our faith. (Hebrews 12:1-2).

The Christian life of faith, is like an athlete running a race in a crowded stadium, surrounded by spectators of saints. The saints are there to cheer us. The lives of the saints inspire us. The prayers of the saints energize us.
To press on, keeping our eyes on the Lord Jesus, the finishing point. With endurance we finished the race.
“I have fought the good fight,
  I have finished the race
  And I have remained faithful.
  And now the prize awaits me,
  The crown of righteousness which
  Will give me on the day of His return.” (2 Timothy 4:7-8).

### Prayer of Thanks
O Lord 
I Thank You
For your Saints
Who surround Me,
To inspire me by their lives.
And support me by their prayers.
In the journey of my life.
And wait to welcome me.
When I reach the end.
