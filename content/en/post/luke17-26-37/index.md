### Gospel
> 26 As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be in the days of the Son of Man;

> 27 they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage up to the day that Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.

> 28 Similarly, as it was in the days of Lot: they were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building;

> 29 on the day when Lot left Sodom, fire and brimstone rained from the sky to destroy them all.

> 30 So it will be on the day the Son of Man is revealed.

> 31 On that day, a person who is on the housetop and whose belongings are in the house must not go down to get them, and likewise a person in the field must not return to what was left behind.

> 32 Remember the wife of Lot.

> 33 Whoever seeks to preserve his life will lose it, but whoever loses it will save it.

> 34 I tell you, on that night there will be two people in one bed; one will be taken, the other left.

> 35 And there will be two women grinding meal together; one will be taken, the other left."

> 37 They said to him in reply, "Where, Lord?" He said to them, "Where the body is, there also the vultures will gather."

### Reflection:
The Gospel for today is a bit unsettling.  The reading begins with Jesus saying to his disciples: “As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be in the days of the Son of Man.” They were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage up to the day Noah, his family and friends entered the ark.  The flood of water quickly followed and destroyed everything on the earth.  Jesus then talks about Lot.  In Lot’s time they also were eating, drinking as well as buying and selling.  On the day Lot and his family left Sodom, fire and brimstone rained down upon them from the sky.

What was Jesus trying to tell his listeners?  What is Jesus saying to us today? We all know that at some point, the “end of time” will come.  However, we do not know the day or the hour it will arrive.  Nor do we know what this experience will be like.  The stark description Jesus gives us is not an inviting nor a hopeful message.

The gift is: today and every day we have a choice.  Each morning, I can ask myself: How will I live my life today?  Will I choose to carouse as they did in Noah’s day?  Every day we have a choice.  If we live each day in a loving manner, we will have no need to be fearful of dying.  However, if we are hurtful or indifferent to the individuals in our lives and to the world, we may get some “fire and brimstone.”

Every choice we make is a significant choice!  Today (every day) is a good day to make thoughtful and loving choices and decisions.  If we strive to love each and every day, we will have no need to be afraid of dying!  The gates of heaven will be wide open and Jesus will be waiting for us and he will welcome us with open and loving arms!  It is our decision to make.  What will we choose?
