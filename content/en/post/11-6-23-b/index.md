> Psalms 102: 17 he will listen to the prayers of the destitute, for he is never too busy to heed their requests. Remember prayers is dialogue with GOD. We must not do all the talking but we must give God the opportunity to speak to us in return. When we talk to god we can ask Him for things that we may need.

### Prayer is talking with God.
God is looking at our hearts and He wants us to come and talk to Him and hear Him talk to us and lead us and guide us in the journey of life. Prayer is the communication process between us and the Lord.

### Developing our thought life into a prayer life.
So much of our lives are consumed with our thoughts and our thought of life. We think about things, worry about things, concern ourselves over things, get distressed and fearful and we even get stressed and anxious. Jesus taught us to pray to our Father: Lk 11: 2.

### God has time for you.
God is not busy to listen to you. He is ready and able to give you His full attention Jeremiah 18: 1-2.

### Ask God
When we talk with God we can ask for those that we may need. I am so glad that we can approach God in this way: Matthew 6: 6, Luke 11: 9-10.
Just talk with God about them and letâ€™s begin to trust Him.
Expecting God to come through for you.

### Believe god in 3 areas:
- believe in the character of god. He is faithful and he does care for us
- we must believe in the integrity of God. If He said He will do something-He Will.
- we must believe that HE IS ABLE. we must believe there is nothing is to hard for Him Isaiah 65:24.

Nothing is impossible with God

Yours In Christ,
