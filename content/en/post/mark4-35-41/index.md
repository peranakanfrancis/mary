### :love_letter: Gospel
> On that day, as evening drew on, he said to them, “Let us cross to the other side.” Leaving the crowd, they took him with them in the boat just as he was. And other boats were with him.

> A violent squall came up and waves were breaking over the boat, so that it was already filling up. Jesus was in the stern, asleep on a cushion. They woke him and said to him, “Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?”

> He woke up, rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Quiet! Be still!” The wind ceased and there was great calm. Then he asked them, “Why are you terrified? Do you not yet have faith?” They were filled with great awe and said to one another, “Who then is this whom even wind and sea obey?

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
And there was great calm!  Though this is a reference to the quieting of the sea, it is also a message spoken about the turmoil we face at times in life.  Jesus wants to bring great calm to our lives.

It’s so very easy to get discouraged in life.  It’s so very easy to focus in on the chaos that is all around us.  Be it a harsh and biting word from another, a family problem, civil unrest, financial concerns, etc., there are plenty of reasons for each one of us to fall into the trap of fear, frustration, depression and anxiety.

But it was for this reason that Jesus allowed this event to take place with His disciples.  He got into the boat with His disciples and allowed them to experience a fierce storm while He slept, so that He could bring from this experience a clear and convincing message to us all.

In this story, the disciples focused in on one thing: They were perishing!  The sea was tossing them and they feared imminent disaster.  But through it all, Jesus was there sound asleep, waiting for them to wake Him.  And when they woke Him, He took control of the storm and brought perfect calm.  

The same is true in our lives.  We are so easily rattled by the stresses and difficulties of daily life.  We so often allow ourselves to be overwhelmed by problems we face.  The key is to turn our eyes to Jesus.  See Him there, before you, sleeping and waiting for you to rouse Him.  He is always there, always waiting, always ready.  

Waking our Lord is as simple as turning our eyes from the stormy sea and trusting in His divine presence.  It’s all about trust.  Total and unyielding trust.  Do you trust Him?

### :latin_cross: Meditation
Reflect, today, upon that which causes you daily anxiety, fear or confusion.  What is it that appears to be tossing you here and there causing you stress and worry?  As you see this burden, see also Jesus there with you, waiting for you to come to Him in trust so that He can take control of every situation in life in which you find yourself.  He loves you and will indeed take care of you.

### :pray: Prayer
My sleeping Lord, I turn to You in the midst of the challenges of life and desire to rouse You to come to my aid.  I know You are always near, waiting for me to trust You in all things.  Help me to turn my eyes to You and to have faith in Your perfect love for me.  Jesus, I trust in You.
