### Word of God
> “No need to remember past events, no need to think about what was done before.” - (Isaiah 43:18)

### Reflection
One of the beautiful things about life in Christ is that every day is a new beginning. A fresh start. We do not have to regret yesterday or dread tomorrow. We can celebrate today, thankful for God’s presence in the moment.

There is a saying I love that goes like this: “Yesterday is History. Tomorrow is a Mystery. Today is a Gift, that is why it is called the Present.”

We can enjoy every moment of our lives and stay focused on the Present. We should not dwell on the past or look too far into the future, but we need to realize the Present moment is God’s Gift to us right now. Let us make the decision to be grateful for today, live it to the full, and enjoy every part of it!

### Prayer of Thanks
O Lord my God, Thank you for the gift of today. Regardless of my past problems or my future challenges, I choose to celebrate my Life with you in the Present. Thank you that this is the Day you have made. I will rejoice and be glad in it.
