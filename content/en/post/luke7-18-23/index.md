### Gospel
> The disciples of John told him about all these things. John summoned two of his disciples and sent them to the Lord to ask, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?” When the men came to him, they said, “John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?’” At that time he cured many of their diseases, sufferings, and evil spirits; he also granted sight to many who were blind. And he said to them in reply, “Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind regain their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the good news proclaimed to them. And blessed is the one who takes no offense at me.”

### Reflection:
Jesus speaks here of those who are “blind, lame, lepers, deaf, dead and poor.”  Each one of these people are identified as being blessed by the ministry of Jesus.  

As we continue to get closer to Christmas we must continue to look at our weakness.  We must see how we, too, are blind, lame, a leper, etc.  Of course these physical ailments point to something much deeper.  They point to the spiritual ailments that we all encounter.

Jesus also says something quite interesting.  He says, “And blessed is the one who takes no offense at me.”  Why would we be offended by Jesus?  What is this all about?

Jesus is perfectly direct and honest.  In fact, He obviously speaks nothing but pure truth.  The hard part is that, at times, the truth can hurt.  We can go through life thinking that we are healthy and well, spiritually speaking, and as a result, we can tend to think that we do not need the truth Jesus came to preach.  In that case, when we are confronted with our sin or any truth we struggle with, we can be offended by Christ.

Reflect, today, upon how completely open you are to the full truth of the Gospel.  Are you ready and willing to listen to everything Jesus proclaims?  Are you ready and willing to accept the full Gospel in your life?  Let Advent be a time when you deepen your resolve to listen and heed all that our Lord wants to say to you.  And if you see yourself “offended” in any way, know that the area of offense is most likely the area you need to work on the most.

### Prayer
Lord, help me in the Advent season to continue to prepare my heart for You.  Help me to listen to Your Word and to heed all that You have to say.  May I follow You in all things and above all things and never be offended by Your Word.  Jesus, I trust in You.
