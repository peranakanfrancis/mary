### :love_letter: Gospel
> The one who comes from above is above all. The one who is of the earth is earthly and speaks of earthly things. But the one who comes from heaven is above all. He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony.

> Whoever does accept his testimony certifies that God is trustworthy. For the one whom God sent speaks the words of God. He does not ration his gift of the Spirit. The Father loves the Son and has given everything over to him. Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains upon him.

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
At wartime, when soldiers have a scarce amount of food, they have to ration it.  They only eat small measured portions each day so that the food will last as long as possible.  If they do not, they may run out and starve.

What if this were the case with God and His grace?  What if the Holy Spirit were to say to us, “Now I’m only going to help you to a limited degree.  Once you use up the grace I’m offering you, you’re on your own.”  Ouch!  That would be problematic.

Of course the good news is that God acts in the completely opposite way with us.  He commits to a full outpouring of the Holy Spirit and offers all the grace we could ever need or want.  The problem is that we often “ration” His grace anyway.  We don’t do this because we believe God is limited.  Rather, we often do it because we are afraid to let God unleash His almighty power in our lives.

### :latin_cross: Meditation
Reflect, today, upon what your life would look like if you let God do whatever He wanted with you.  What would change?  How would your daily life, your relationships, your words, your actions and your future be different?  Intellectually speaking, we know it’s right to fully embrace the will of God in all things.  But when it actually comes to doing it, there is often much hesitancy. It may be fear of the unknown.  Or it may be that we do not fully want to change.  Whatever the case may be, God is offering you an unlimited amount of grace by the full outpouring of the Holy Spirit.  It’s up to you to decide if you will ration or not.

### :pray: Prayer
Lord of superabundance, I do want to let You do whatever You want in my life.  I want to be fully immersed in Your grace.  Help me to say “Yes” to You no matter what that leads to and help me to trust in this glorious “Yes” You are calling me to make.  Jesus, I trust in You.
