Lord, Hear my prayer!
Listen to my plea!
Do not turn away from me
In my time of distress.
Bend down to listen,
And answer me quickly
When I call to you. (Psalm 102:1-2).

### Prayer of Thanks
“Then Jesus looked up to heaven. And said “Father, thank you for hearing me. You always hear me.” (John 11:41).
