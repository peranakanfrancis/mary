### Gospel
When they were near Jerusalem and had come to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them, 'Go to the village facing you, and you will at once find a tethered donkey and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me. If anyone says anything to you, you are to say, "The Master needs them and will send them back at once." '

This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet: Say to the daughter of Zion: Look, your king is approaching, humble and riding on a donkey and on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.

So the disciples went and did as Jesus had told them. They brought the donkey and the colt, then they laid their cloaks on their backs and he took his seat on them. Great crowds of people spread their cloaks on the road, while others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them in his path.

The crowds who went in front of him and those who followed were all shouting: Hosanna to the son of David! Blessed is he who is coming in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest heavens! And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in turmoil as people asked, 'Who is this?' and the crowds answered, 'This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee.'

### Reflection
Most of the crowd spread their garments on the road ahead of Him, and others cut branches from trees and spread them on the road.

Jesus was in the centre of the procession, and the people all around Him were shouting:
“Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He who is coming in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest heaven!”

The entire city of Jerusalem was in an uproar as He entered. “Who is this? “They asked, and the crowds replied, “It is Jesus, the Prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.” (Matthew 21:8-11).

“Palm Sunday” was not a thing of the past. Just as the Lord entered Jerusalem that day on a donkey, so too today He is coming into our midst in the humble form of Bread and Wine.

We greet Him singing!
Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hosts,
Heaven and earth are full of your glory, Hosanna in the highest, 
Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord, 
Hosanna in the highest.

“Whoever is holy, let him approach,
Whoever is not, let him repent.”  (Didache 10.6).

“Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!” (Rev. 22:20).

Hosanna means: “Come to our aid! Save now! A cry for help in distress”.

### The blessed palm leaves hung up in our houses are reminders of:-
- Praise and worship due to the Lord Jesus, “that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow... and every tongue declare that Jesus Christ is Lord.” (Philippians 2:10).
- “The Lord is my helper, so I will have no fear.” (Hebrews 13:6).
- “To know Christ and experience the mighty power that raised him from the dead.” (Philippians 3:10).
- “Please, Lord, rescue me! Come, quickly, Lord, and help me.” (Psalm 40:13).
