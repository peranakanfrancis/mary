While waiting patiently for God to Act.

1. Be still in the presence of the Lord and wait patiently for Him to Act. Psalm 37:7.

2. I waited patiently for the Lord to help me, and He turned to me and heard my cry. He lifted me out of the pit of despair, out of the mud and the mire. He set my feet on solid ground and steadied me as I walked along. He has given me a new song to sing, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see what He has done and be amazed. They will put their trust in the Lord. Psalm 40: 1-4.

3. I am exhausted from crying for help, my throat is parched. My eyes are swollen with weeping, waiting for my God to help me. Psalm 69:3.

4. As for me, I look to the Lord for help. I wait confidently for God to save me, and my God will certainly hear me.

_Fr.Augustine Wong_
