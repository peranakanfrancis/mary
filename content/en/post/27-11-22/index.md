Today, the First Sunday of Advent, we begin a New Liturgical year, the Year A.

In this New Liturgical Year, the Gospel Readings on Sundays and Weekdays are from the Gospel of St. Matthew.

Let us take a glance into the Gospel of St. Matthew to whet our appetite for it.

### INTRODUCTION – TO THE GOSPEL OF ST. MATTHEW.

**Author - Matthew (Levi in Mark 2:14) - A Christian convert from Judaism.** 

About Matthew himself we know very little. We read of his call in Matthew 9:9.
We know that he was a Tax Collector and that he must therefore have been a bitterly hated man, for the Jews hated the members of their own race who had entered the civil service of their conquerors. Matthew would be regarded as nothing better than a traitor. But there was one gift which Matthew would possess. Most of the disciples were fishermen. They would have little skill and little practice in putting words together on paper. But Matthew would be an expert in that. When Jesus called Matthew, as he sat at his tax collector’s booth, Matthew rose and followed Jesus and left everything behind him except one thing, his pen. And Matthew used his literary skill to become the first man ever to compile an account of the preaching and healing of Jesus.

Refer to the statue of Matthew in the Church. He is holding a pen!

### Date Written: 
Probably between A.D. 50 and 60. Perhaps from the City of Antioch, Syria.

### Audience: Jewish Christians.
Matthew wanted Jewish Christians readers to know that believing in Jesus was not a break with their tradition but a continuation of it.

Matthew demonstrates that all the prophecies, hopes of the Old Testament are fulfilled in Jesus. Therefore, Jesus must be the long expected promised Messiah. Thus, the Gospel of Matthew has one phrase which runs through it like an ever-recurring theme. “This fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through the Prophet.” (Matthew 2:15)

That phase occurs in the Gospel as often as 16 times.

### The Theme: 
Jesus gives the Kingdom of God the first place in his preaching. What he announces in the small town of Galilee is the Good News of the Kingdom (Matthew 4:23, 9:35). “Kingdom of God” writes Mark. “Kingdom of Heaven” writes Matthew. The two expressions are equivalent.

The Kingdom of God is the Rule/Reign of the saving power of the love and word of God. Accompanying the preaching, the miracles are the signs of the presence the Kingdom, the Lordship of God.

With the coming of the Reign/Rule of God, the domination of Satan and Sin over man is at an end. “But if I am casting out demons by the Spirit of God, then the Kingdom of God has arrived among you.” (Matthew 12:28)

It follows that it is necessary to repent. “From then on Jesus began to preach, repent of your sins and turn to God, for the Kingdom of Heaven is near.” (Matthew 4:17)

To repent of our sins and turn to God, and welcome the Lord Jesus, His Love and Teaching, to rule our mind, heart and will, to be a Disciple of Jesus. To live “A rich and satisfying life.” (John 10:10)

The Emblem/Symbol: The Man (Ezekiel 1:10, Revelation 4:7)
Refer to the Statue of St. Matthew in the Church.
