We must remember the Love of God, which ever desires only what is best for us.

We must remember the Wisdom of God, which alone knows what is best for us.

We must remember the Power of God, which alone can bring to pass that which is best for us.

When we pray, with a perfect trust in the Love, Wisdom and Power of God, we will find peace of mind and heart, “A gift the world cannot give”. (John 14:27)

“Do not worry about anything. Instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank Him for all He has done. Then you will experience the peace of God, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus.” (Philippians 4:6-7).
