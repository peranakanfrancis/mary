### Illness in Human Life
Illness and suffering have always been among the gravest problems confronting in Human Life. In illness, man experience his powerlessness, his limitations and his finitude. Every illness can make us glimpse death.

“For I am the Lord who heals you.” (Exodus 15:26).

The compassion of Jesus toward the sick, “Jesus travelled throughout the region of Galilee, teaching in the synagogues and announcing the Good News about the Kingdom and he healed every kind of disease and illness. 

News about Him spread as far as Syria, and people soon began bringing to Him all who were sick.
And whatever their sickness or disease, or if they were demon possessed or epileptic or paralyzed, He healed them all.” (Matthew 4:23-24).

### Healed the Sick
“Jesus sent out the twelve apostles with these instructions” (Matthew 10:5) “Heal the sick” (Matthew 10:8).
Jesus continues His ministry of preaching and healing at mass.
At the first part of the mass, the liturgy of the word, Jesus continues His Ministry of preaching.
Jesus continues His Ministry of healing at the Liturgy of the Eucharist, the second part of the Mass. The heart and summit of the celebration.

At the prayer of consecration, in the institution narrative. 

“But He was pierced for our rebellion, crushed for our sins.  He was beaten so we could be whole, he was whipped so we could be healed”. (Isaiah 53:5).

When priest shows the consecrated host (“My Body which will be given up for you”) to the people. Bows slightly in adoration, saying, “My Lord and My God” (John 20:28). Lord “Jesus, remember me” heal me of ______. (Luke 23:42).

Do the same when the priest shows the chalice (“of My Blood. Poured out for you”).

After the prayer “Our Father” the priest prays 2 prayers for healing in preparation for Holy Communion.

Listen attentively and own it to experience the healing it express.

Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil, graciously grant peace in our days, that, by the help of your mercy, we may be always free from sin, and safe from all distress, as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our saviour, Jesus Christ.

May the receiving of your body and blood, Lord Jesus Christ, not bring me to judgement and condemnation, but through your loving mercy be for me protection in mind and body, and a healing remedy.

Pray with expectant faith: Lord, I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.

On receiving “the Body of Christ” affirm it with Joyful Hope “Amen”.

### Prayer after Holy Communion.
Treasure the silent moment after Holy Communion for personal praise and worship.

Lord Jesus Christ, I praise and thank you for coming to me.

You are my Lord and God. Only say the word and I shall be healed.

Thanks for giving me Your Holy Body and Precious Blood. May Your Body nourish and strengthen me.

May Your Precious Blood flow throughout my Body to heal and restore me in mind and body, especially to my ______ to heal and restore it.

Lord Jesus Christ as I eat your Body and drink your Precious Blood, equip me with your Holy Spirit, to empower me to live a new “rich and satisfying life” (John 10:10).

Lord Jesus Christ!  I Love You!  Lord Jesus Christ! In You I trust.

“Your faith has made you well, go in peace. Your suffering is over.” (Mark 5:34).
