### Gospel
> 24 "But in those days after that tribulation the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light,

> 25 and the stars will be falling from the sky, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.

> 26 And then they will see 'the Son of Man coming in the clouds' with great power and glory,

> 27 and then he will send out the angels and gather (his) elect from the four winds, from the end of the earth to the end of the sky.

> 28 "Learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branch becomes tender and sprouts leaves, you know that summer is near.

> 29 In the same way, when you see these things happening, know that he is near, at the gates.

> 30 Amen, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place.

> 31 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.

> 32 "But of that day or hour, no one knows, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.

### Reflection
Yes, it is true.  Heaven as it is now and Earth as it is now will pass away.  The Gospels and the Book of Revelation speak to this truth.  As we draw close to the end of this liturgical year, we are reminded of this fact.  We are reminded that Jesus will return in splendor and glory and will make all things new.  The world as we know it will be made anew, and Heaven will be joined to this new Earth, and all will be one.  Jesus will reign in this new world as the glorious King of all.

One thing this tells us is that we should not become overly attached to the things of this passing world.  True, earthly wealth and possessions may offer a temporary satisfaction to our lives, but never a permanent satisfaction.  In time, the things of this world will all disappear.  So, if we work to build up only earthly wealth and possessions, we should know that all those things will eventually pass away, and we would be left with nothing.  

So what is it that is eternal?  The answer is given in the passage above.  Jesus says that His “words will not pass away.”  Namely, all that is true and revealed by God as true is eternal and worth holding on to.  This reveals to us that Jesus’ words are the true riches that we must seek.  By embracing His Word, clinging to it, entering into it, believing it and letting it change us, we are embracing the eternal.  We are embracing that which we will have for all eternity.  This is an important truth to understand and live.

Reflect, today, upon the simple fact that everything in life is passing away except the words of our Lord.  All that He has spoken and revealed to us will remain for all time, and these truths are the only thing in life worth working for.  Turn your eyes to the Word of God and try to grasp its meaning more deeply so that you can begin to build up treasure in Heaven here and now!

### Prayer
Lord, I do believe all that You have spoken and revealed.  Help me to listen to You all the more and to cling to Your every word.  Jesus, I trust in You.
