### Gospel
> Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart; and you will find rest for yourselves. For my yoke is easy, and my burden light.

### Reflection
The Gospel reading for today is a gentle, loving and tender passage. Jesus says to each of us: “Come to me! Bring your burdens, your sorrows and your pain to me. I will lift your burden from your shoulders. I will ease your pain and your sorrow!”

Then stay with me for a while and “learn from me.” If you do this every day, you will find rest, true rest. You will be peaceful, serene and joyful! Truly my “yoke is easy, and my burden light.” “Come to me!” I am here waiting for you! I will wait forever if I need to! Will you come today?
