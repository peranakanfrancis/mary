In his farewell speech to his apostles, Jesus tells them that he will return to the Father, but will not leave them orphaned (John 14:18). The Father will give them another advocate/helper, the Holy Spirit (John 14:26) to help them.
“He will teach you everything and will remind you of everything I have told you.” (John 14:26).

“You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you.” (Acts 1:8).
After the arrest and death of Jesus “The disciples were meeting behind locked doors because they were afraid of the Jewish Leaders.” (John 20:19). But this was reversed on Pentecost day.

On the day of Pentecost “everyone present was filled with the Holy Spirit and began speaking in other (New) languages, as the Holy Spirit gave them this ability.” (Acts 2:4).

No more fearful and timid, the disciples, went forth from “behind locked door” witnessing “the wonderful things God has done.” (Acts 2:11).

Come Holy Spirit, Our Helper, I need you.
Teach and empower me to prosper and succeed in all I do. Alleluia.
