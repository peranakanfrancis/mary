### :love_letter: Gospel
> “On another occasion he began to teach by the sea. A very large crowd gathered around him so that he got into a boat on the sea and sat down. And the whole crowd was beside the sea on land.

> And he taught them at length in parables, and in the course of his instruction he said to them, “Hear this! A sower went out to sow. And as he sowed, some seed fell on the path, and the birds came and ate it up. Other seed fell on rocky ground where it had little soil. It sprang up at once because the soil was not deep. And when the sun rose, it was scorched and it withered for lack of roots.

> Some seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it and it produced no grain. He added, “Whoever has ears to hear ought to hear.”

> And when he was alone, those present along with the Twelve questioned him about the parables. He answered them, “The mystery of the kingdom of God has been granted to you. But to those outside everything comes in parables, so that ‘they may look and see but not perceive, and hear and listen but not understand, in order that they may not be converted and be forgiven.’”

> Jesus said to them, “Do you not understand this parable? Then how will you understand any of the parables? The sower sows the word. These are the ones on the path where the word is sown. As soon as they hear, Satan comes at once and takes away the word sown in them. And these are the ones sown on rocky ground who, when they hear the word, receive it at once with joy. But they have no root; they last only for a time. Then when tribulation or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.

> Those sown among thorns are another sort. They are the people who hear the word, but worldly anxiety, the lure of riches, and the craving for other things intrude and choke the word, and it bears no fruit. But those sown on rich soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit thirty and sixty and a hundredfold.”

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
This line begins the familiar Parable of the Sower.  We are aware of the details of this parable in that the sower sows seed on the path, on rocky ground, among thorns and ultimately on good soil.  The story reveals that we must strive to be like that “good soil” in that we must receive the Word of God into our souls, allowing it to be nurtured so that it may grow in abundance.

But this parable reveals something more that could easily be missed.  It reveals the simple fact that the sower, in order to plant at least some seed in good and fertile soil, must act.  He must act by going forth spreading seed in abundance.  As he does this, he must not become disheartened if the majority of the seed he has sown fails to reach that good soil.  The path, the rocky ground, and the thorny ground all are places where seed is sown but ultimately dies.  Only one of the four places identified in this parable produces growth.

Jesus is the Divine Sower and His Word is the Seed. Therefore, we should realize that we are also called to act in His person by sowing the seed of His Word in our own lives.  Just as He is willing to sow with the realization that not every seed will produce fruit, so also we must be ready and willing to accept this same fact.  

The truth is that, very often, the labor we offer to God for the building up of His Kingdom produces little or no manifest fruit in the end.  Hearts become hardened and the good we do, or the Word we share, does not grow.

One lesson we must take from this parable is that the spreading of the Gospel requires effort and commitment on our part.  We must be willing to toil and labor for the Gospel despite whether or not people are willing to receive it.  And we must not allow ourselves to become discouraged if the results are not what we had hoped for.

### :latin_cross: Meditation
Reflect, today, upon the mission you have been given by Christ to spread His Word.  Say “Yes” to that mission and then look for ways, each and every day, to sow His Word.  Expect much of the effort you give to unfortunately bear little fruit in a manifest way.  However, have deep hope and confidence in the fact that some of that seed will reach the soil that our Lord desires it to reach.  Commit yourself to the sowing; God will worry about the rest.

### :pray: Prayer
My divine Sower, I make myself available to You for the purpose of the Gospel.  I promise to serve You, each and every day, and I commit to being a sower of Your divine Word.  Help me not to become too focused on the results of the effort I give; rather, help me to entrust those results only to You and to Your divine providence.  Jesus, I trust in You.
