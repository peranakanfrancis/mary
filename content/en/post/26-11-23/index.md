> “So encourage each other and build each other up, just as you are already doing.”
(1 Thessalonians 5:11)

One of the best things you can do for someone is encourage them and build them up. Say something positive to the people around you about who they are or how much you appreciate them. Or tell them how much God loves them and wants to bless them. Encouragement is powerful. It makes people feel better in every way.

Think about the people you are going to be around today.
Be thankful that they are in your life, and ask God to help you speak encouraging words to them. You might be surprised at what a difference it will make, not only for them, but for you too.

### Prayer of Thanks
O God,
As I am going through my day, 
I pray that you will show me ways I can encourage and build people up.
Thank you for opportunities you give me to make a difference in the lives of others.
I want to seize my opportunities today.
