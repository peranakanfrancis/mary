In time of insecurity and fear, pray psalm 23 slowly, letting God fill you with peace and security.

### Psalm 23, The Divine Shepherd:
The Lord is my shepherd, I have all that I need.
He lets me rest in green meadows. 
He leads me beside peaceful streams, He renews my strength,
He guides me along right paths, bringing honour to His name.
Even when I walk through the darkest valley,  I will not be afraid, For you are close beside me, 
Your rod and your staff protect and comfort me.
You prepare a feast for me in the presence of my enemies.
You honour me by anointing my head with oil.
My cup overflows with blessing, surely your goodness and unfailing love will pursue me all the days of my life.
And I will live in the house of the Lord forever.

### Pray to the Lord to send more priests
Jesus travelled through all the towns and villages of the area, teaching in the Synagogues and announcing the Good News about the kingdom. And He healed every kind of Disease and illness. 

When He saw the crowds, He had compassion on them because they were confused and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. He said to His Disciples, “The harvest is great, but the workers are few. So pray to the Lord who is in charge of the Harvest, ask Him to send more workers into His fields.” (Matthew 9: 35-38).
