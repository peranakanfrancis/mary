### Gospel
> 25 There was a scholar of the law who stood up to test him and said, "Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"

> 26 Jesus said to him, "What is written in the law? How do you read it?"

> 27 He said in reply, "You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your being, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself."

> 28 He replied to him, "You have answered correctly; do this and you will live."

> 29 But because he wished to justify himself, he said to Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"

> 30 Jesus replied, "A man fell victim to robbers as he went down from Jerusalem to Jericho. They stripped and beat him and went off leaving him half-dead.

> 31 A priest happened to be going down that road, but when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.

> 32 Likewise a Levite came to the place, and when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.

> 33 But a Samaritan traveler who came upon him was moved with compassion at the sight.

> 34 He approached the victim, poured oil and wine over his wounds and bandaged them. Then he lifted him up on his own animal, took him to an inn and cared for him.

> 35 The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper with the instruction, 'Take care of him. If you spend more than what I have given you, I shall repay you on my way back.'

> 36 Which of these three, in your opinion, was neighbor to the robbers' victim?"

> 37 He answered, "The one who treated him with mercy." Jesus said to him, "Go and do likewise."

### Reflection:
Today a scholar of the law decides to test Jesus.  The scholar asked Jesus: “Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”  As a scholar the man was well versed in the law.  Was he simply curious to how Jesus might respond to his question?  Or was the scholar testing Jesus?

Jesus immediately replied to his question.  He names the first two commandments given to us by God: “Love God with your heart, your strength and your mind.  And love your neighbor as yourself.”  Although the scholar told Jesus: “You have answered correctly,” the scholar was not satisfied with Jesus’ answer. He then asks Jesus another question: “Who is my neighbor?”   This time Jesus did not directly answer the scholar’s question.  Rather he presented a scenario.  “A man was traveling to Jericho and was attacked by robbers.”  Jesus told the scholar that the robbers first took the man’s clothing, his money and his valuables.  Then they beat him and then left him for dead on the roadside.

After a time, a priest came by.  When he saw the man, the priest crossed to the other side of the road and continued on his way.  A while later a Levite came by.  He also ignored the man and traveled on.  Finally a Samaritan came by and saw the man.  However, this man, a Samaritan, responded with concern and compassion.  He approached the man and poured oil on his wounds to cleanse them.  Then he put the man on his own animal and took him to an inn.  When they arrived there, the Samaritan himself washed the man’s wounds and cared for him.  The next day the Samaritan needed to continue on his journey.  However, he placed the wounded man in the care of the innkeeper and he gave the innkeeper money for the man’s expenses.   The Samaritan promised to return after he had finished his business.  And if the man’s expenses had been more than the money that he had given the innkeeper, the Samaritan would reimburse him for the additional expenses.

Today I invite you to seriously ask yourself: What am I doing to ensure that I will inherit eternal life?  Am I reaching out to the “Samaritans” in my life?  Do I consciously attend to the people in my life?  Or do I simply take them for granted?  

At times in our lives, we will be “the man (or woman) who was stripped and beaten.”  We may experience family difficulties, financial problems, depression or anxiety.   At these times, what a blessing it is when a friend, family member, neighbor or co-worker reaches out to us.  Their care and attentiveness to us truly may be “balm for our souls.”   And today, if you notice someone who seems to be struggling, reach out to them.  You may be the very gift they need at that point.  And hopefully a friend, family member or even a stranger will reach out to us when we are struggling.  Jesus works through us and in us!  Today may we act and react to others as Jesus did!
