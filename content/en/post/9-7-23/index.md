> “Do not worry about anything, instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank Him for all He has done. Then you will experience God’s peace, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus.” (Philippians 4:6-7).

Worry is totally useless. When we begin to look at worry in a realistic manner, we see what a complete waste it is.
Our minds revolve endlessly around and around a problem, searching for answers that only God has. Worry is tormenting.
We can pray and ask God to help us not to worry, but ultimately, we must choose to put our thoughts on something other than our problems.
A refusal to worry is proof that we trust God to work on our behalf.
If you are willing to give up worrying, then you will be able to enter into an attitude of celebration and thanksgiving.
You can trust God and enjoy life while He solves your problems.
Give yourself permission to stop worrying.
Worry nothing, pray for everything.

Prayer of thanks
Lord Jesus Christ,
Help me to focus, on You rather than focusing on my problems.
I thank You that I do not have to let worry rule my life. 
I can choose to live with Peace by Trusting You.
Amen.

“Give all your worries and cares to God, for he cares about you.” (1 Peter 5:7).
