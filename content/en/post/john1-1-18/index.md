subtitle: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  He was in the beginning with God.  All things came to be through him, and without him nothing came to be.  What came to be through him was life, and this life was the light of the human race; the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.

### :love_letter: Gospel
> In the beginning* was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came to be through him, and without him nothing came to be. What came to be through him was life, and this life was the light of the human race; the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. A man named John was sent from God. He came for testimony, to testify to the light, so that all might believe through him. He was not the light, but came to testify to the light. The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world came to be through him, but the world did not know him. He came to what was his own, but his own people did not accept him. But to those who did accept him he gave power to become children of God, to those who believe in his name, who were born not by natural generation nor by human choice nor by a man’s decision but of God. And the Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us, and we saw his glory, the glory as of the Father’s only Son, full of grace and truth. John testified to him and cried out, saying, “This was he of whom I said, ‘The one who is coming after me ranks ahead of me because he existed before me.’” From his fullness we have all received, grace in place of grace, because while the law was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God. The only Son, God,* who is at the Father’s side, has revealed him.

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
On this, the seventh day of the Octave of Christmas, we are given a mystery.  The mystery of the “Word.”  It’s a language that is veiled and yet revealing at the same time.  It presents Jesus to us as the “Word.”  He is the Word who takes on flesh and is eternal, from “the beginning with God.”  The passage goes on to say that the Word was God and that the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.

The term “Word,” given to Jesus in this passage, is a translation of the Greek word “Logos.”  Logos means “plan,” “reason,” “logic.”  It also can be understood as the spoken word.  In this passage, it especially reveals to us that God “spoke” from eternity His perfect plan of salvation and this wisdom spoken is a Person.  The Person is the Divine Son of God.  Thus, when the Son “speaks” and when He is “spoken” by the Father, all things come to be.

Perhaps that’s quite confusing.  In fact, this is partly the point.  The point is that this beginning to John’s Gospel reveals to us that the action of God creating all things and ultimately fulfilling His wisdom through the Incarnation, the Son becoming flesh, is a mysterious plan far beyond what we could ever comprehend or fathom.  We should see this mysterious language as a statement in and of itself.  The statement is this:  Seek to understand the mystery, but know that the mystery of Christmas and Creation is beyond you.  But seek to understand and comprehend nonetheless.

Christmas should be a time of great joy and celebration.  It should be a time in which we reflect upon the nativity of Christ the Lord.  We should read the story, listen to Christmas music and not set that all aside until our Christmas season is over.  But as we do all of that, we should always keep before us the fact that Christmas is a great mystery of faith.

### :latin_cross: Meditation
Reflect, today, upon this language of St. John.  “In the beginning was the Word…” “The Word was God…”  “The Word became flesh…”  Let yourself know, this day, that you do not fully know this mystery and as you face this reality, allow the Eternal Word to draw you in one step deeper as we continue to celebrate the glorious Octave of Christmas Day.

### :pray: Prayer
Lord, Jesus, Eternal Word of the Father, I thank You for coming among us and for making Your eternal dwelling present to us.  Thank You for the great mystery of Christmas.  Help me to always celebrate this season with great joy and gratitude, and also with a sense of mystery.  May I always realize that the mystery of Christmas will never be fully understood.  May this mystery draw me closer each and every day so that I may fall more deeply in love with You, my eternal God.  Jesus, I trust in You.
