### Gospel
> Each year his parents went to Jerusalem for the feast of Passover, and when he was twelve years old, they went up according to festival custom. After they had completed its days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, but his parents did not know it. Thinking that he was in the caravan, they journeyed for a day and looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances, but not finding him, they returned to Jerusalem to look for him. After three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions, and all who heard him were astounded at his understanding and his answers. When his parents saw him, they were astonished, and his mother said to him, “Son, why have you done this to us? Your father and I have been looking for you with great anxiety.” And he said to them, “Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?” But they did not understand what he said to them. He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them; and his mother kept all these things in her heart. And Jesus advanced [in] wisdom and age and favor before God and man.

### Reflection
On this, the Sunday within the Octave of Christmas, we honor the Holy Family of Jesus, Mary and Joseph.  In honoring them, we also honor all families, big or small.  And in honoring all families, we honor the family of God, the Church.  But most especially, we focus in on the hidden, day-to-day life of the Holy Family of Nazareth.

What was it like to live day in and day out in the household of St. Joseph?  What was it like to have Jesus for a son, Mary as a wife and mother, and Joseph as a father and husband?  Their home would have certainly been a sacred place and a dwelling of true peace and unity.  But it would have also been so much more.

The family home of Jesus, Mary and Joseph would have been, in numerous ways, just like any other home.  They would have related together, talked, had fun, disagreed, worked, eaten, dealt with problems, and encountered everything else that makes up daily family life.

Of course, the virtues of Jesus and Mary were perfect, and St. Joseph was a truly “just man.”  Therefore, the overriding characteristic of their home would have been love.  

But with that said, their family would not have been exempt from daily toil, hurt and challenges that face most families.  For example, they would have encountered the death of loved ones, St. Joseph most likely passed away prior to Jesus’ public ministry.  They would have encountered misunderstanding and gossip from others.  Our Blessed Mother, for example, was found with child out of wedlock.  This would have been a topic of discussion among many acquaintances for sure.  They would have had to fulfill all daily chores, earn a living, put food on the table, attend gatherings of family and friends and the like.  They would have lived normal family life in every way.

This is significant because it reveals God’s love for family life.  The Father allowed His Divine Son to live this life and, as a result, elevated family life to a place within the Trinity.  The holiness of the Holy Family reveals to us that every family is invited to share in God’s divine life and to encounter ordinary daily life with grace and virtue.

### Meditation
Reflect, today, upon your own family life.  Some families are strong in virtue, some struggle with basic communication.  Some are faithful day in and day out, some are broken and deeply wounded.  No matter the case, know that God wants to enter more deeply into your family life just as it is right now.  He desires to give you strength and virtue to live as the Holy Family.  Surrender yourself and your family, this day, and invite the Triune God to make your family a holy family.

### Prayer
Lord, I do offer myself to You this day and in doing so I offer You my family.  I offer every relationship, be it good or difficult, and I offer every challenge we face.  Please come and sanctify my family, making it holy in imitation of your family in Nazareth.  Jesus, I trust in You.
