On the day of Pentecost all the believers were meeting together in one place, “behind locked doors because they were afraid of the Jewish Leaders.” (John 20:19).

Suddenly there was a sound from heaven like the roaring of a mighty wind storm, and it filled the house where they were sitting.
Then what looked like flames or tongues of fire appeared and settled on each of them and everyone present was filled with the Holy Spirit and began speaking in other (New) languages as the Holy Spirit gave them this ability.” (Acts 2.2-4).

The disciples had an experience of the power of the Holy Spirit flooding their beings such as they never had before.
Empower by the Holy Spirit, strong and courageous, the Disciples went out into the streets from “behind locked doors” to share “the wonderful things God has done.” (Act.2:11).

Lord Jesus Christ “breath on me” (John 20:22) the Holy Spirit to empower me to be strong and courageous to prosper and succeed in all I do.
