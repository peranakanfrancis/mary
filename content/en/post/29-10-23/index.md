Praying aloud the rosary. The monotonous rhythm is therapeutic, it helps to calm us down and relax.
 
1. To avoid reacting say or do what we will regret later.
2. To see and understand clearly, and to respond appropriately.

“Do not “ I will get even for this wrong.” Wait for the Lord to handle the matter.” Proverbs 20:22
