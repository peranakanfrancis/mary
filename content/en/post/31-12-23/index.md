So God created human beings in His own image.
In the image of God, He created them, male and female He created them.
Then God blessed them and said, be fruitful and multiply.
Fill the earth and govern it. (Genesis 1:27-28).

I lavish unfailing love for a thousand generations on those who love me and obey my commands. (Exodus 20:6).

Fathers can give their sons an inheritance of houses and wealth, but only the Lord can give an understanding wife.

O God, our creator and provider, you create human beings, male and female. You unite them in the sacred bond of marriage.
You bless and command them. 
“Be fruitful and multiply” 
To enrich your Church.
Remind the single young adults of your church your command. 
Be fruitful and multiply.
Grant them the trust in you and the courage to obey your command.
Be fruitful and multiply. Amen.

Holy Mary, Mother of God
Pray for the single young adult. Disciples of your son, to have the trust in God and the strong courage to obey the command. Be fruitful and multiply. For the good of our nation and the good of the church. Amen.
