### Gospel
> 38 John said to him, "Teacher, we saw someone driving out demons in your name, and we tried to prevent him because he does not follow us."

> 39 Jesus replied, "Do not prevent him. There is no one who performs a mighty deed in my name who can at the same time speak ill of me.

> 40 For whoever is not against us is for us.

> 41 Anyone who gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ, amen, I say to you, will surely not lose his reward.

> 42 "Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe (in me) to sin, it would be better for him if a great millstone were put around his neck and he were thrown into the sea.

> 43 If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed than with two hands to go into Gehenna, into the unquenchable fire.

> 45 And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life crippled than with two feet to be thrown into Gehenna.

> 47 And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. Better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into Gehenna,

> 48 where 'their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.'

### Reflection
This Gospel begins as John comes to Jesus and tells him: “Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name! We tried to stop him. After all, he is not one of us!” However, Jesus was calm and he had a completely different perspective than John. Jesus told John: “Whoever is not against us is for us.” Did Jesus sense his disciples were concerned they might have to share “the glory” of being followers of Jesus with others who had not been directly called by Jesus?

Jesus tells his disciples that there is no one who could performs great deeds such as driving out demons or healing in Jesus’ name who would speak ill of Jesus. This would be a complete contradiction of the deed they had done. Jesus continues: “If anyone gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ, that individual will not lose their reward.”

However, Jesus then says that anyone who causes one of His “little ones” to sin will reap his/her punishment. He continues: “It would be better for them if a great millstone was put around their neck and s/he was thrown into the sea.” Jesus continues in this vein for several verses. Clearly, Jesus wants his disciples (and us) to realize what a serious offense it is if we cause one of his little ones to sin. Jesus also gives several graphic examples of the punishment that might be handed out to the perpetrator.

Today may be a good day for us to ask ourselves: do we cause any of the “little ones” to stray from Jesus? We may not be deliberately inviting another person to stray. However, we may subtly or unknowingly invite another to do so. We may be talking with someone and we begin to gossip. Or perhaps we are complaining about work, our co-workers, or the behavior of our children, or perhaps we simply are in a bad mood. The reality is that our attitude and our words affect other people either positively or negatively.

Today may we strive to be a positive and loving presence to each person we encounter. Who knows? This also may help us have a good day!
