His parents did not know what to think. “Son” His mother said to Him, “Why have you done this to us? Your Father and I have been frantic, searching for you everywhere.” (Luke 2:48).

The Gospel of St. Matthew portrays St. Joseph as a “Just man” (Matthew 1:19), the model of openness to and trust in God.

“With a Husband’s love St. Joseph cherished Mary, the Virgin Mother of God” preface of St. Joseph. To see St. Joseph cherishing his wife, Mary, was a great joy and comfort to Jesus.

“With Fatherly care St. Joseph watched over Jesus Christ” preface of St. Joseph, growing in the fatherly care of St. Joseph, caused Jesus, in teaching us to pray, to call God, “Abba, Father.”

A person with an abusive Father will find it difficult to call and experience God as “Abba, Father”.

St. Joseph worked as a Tekton (Matthew 13:55), usually translated “Carpenter”. But probably better understand as “Builder”.

St. Joseph, the Builder of Nazareth, has been popularly designated as the patron of real estate, whose intercession is widely sought in the selling of houses.

With fatherly care St. Joseph watched over and provided well the Holy Family.

With the same fatherly care St. Joseph will watch over and provide well our families.

“To the other saints, it appears that the Lord may have granted to help us on particular occasions, but to St. Joseph, as experience proves, he has granted to help us on all occasions.

Our Lord would teach us, that as he was pleased to be subject to St. Joseph upon earth. So, he is now pleased to grant whatever St. Joseph asks for in heaven. Others whom I have recommended to have recourse to St. Joseph, have known this from experience. (St. Teresa of Avila).

“Good St. Joseph, pray for us.
To be like you, always be open to and trust in God.”
