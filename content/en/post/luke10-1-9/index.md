### Gospel
> 1 After this the Lord appointed seventy[-two] others whom he sent ahead of him in pairs to every town and place he intended to visit.

> 2 He said to them, "The harvest is abundant but the laborers are few; so ask the master of the harvest to send out laborers for his harvest.

> 3 Go on your way; behold, I am sending you like lambs among wolves.

> 4 Carry no money bag, no sack, no sandals; and greet no one along the way.

> 5 Into whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace to this household.'

> 6 If a peaceful person lives there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you.

> 7 Stay in the same house and eat and drink what is offered to you, for the laborer deserves his payment. Do not move about from one house to another.

> 8 Whatever town you enter and they welcome you, eat what is set before you,

> 9 cure the sick in it and say to them, 'The kingdom of God is at hand for you.'

### Reflection:
Today the Church celebrates the feast day of St. Luke, one of the four evangelists. In today’s reading, Jesus sends 72 of his disciples out into the towns and villages that he intended to visit. These 72 disciples were to inform the people that he was coming. They were to prepare the way for him.

Jesus then gives the disciples instructions for this journey. He tells his disciples to pack lightly for the journey. They should not take any money, luggage, or sandals. Jesus tells them they are to trust that God will provide for them.

I wonder how the disciples reacted to Jesus’ statement! Ask yourself: if you were sent on a journey and you were told to take nothing with you except the clothes on your back, how would you react? Personally I would be tempted to pack a “little” bag just in case I needed something!

Today Jesus is sending us forth to preach the “Good News.” He gives us the same instructions that he gave the Apostles: “take nothing with you.” All we are to take with us is the “Good News” of Jesus. What is the good news of Jesus that you want to share today?
