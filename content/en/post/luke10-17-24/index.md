### Gospel
> 17 The seventy (-two) returned rejoicing, and said, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us because of your name."

> 18 Jesus said, "I have observed Satan fall like lightning from the sky.

> 19 Behold, I have given you the power 'to tread upon serpents' and scorpions and upon the full force of the enemy and nothing will harm you.

> 20 Nevertheless, do not rejoice because the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice because your names are written in heaven."

> 21 At that very moment he rejoiced (in) the holy Spirit and said, "I give you praise, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for although you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned you have revealed them to the childlike. Yes, Father, such has been your gracious will.

> 22 All things have been handed over to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal him."

> 23 Turning to the disciples in private he said, "Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.

> 24 For I say to you, many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, but did not see it, and to hear what you hear, but did not hear it."

### Reflection:
This Gospel opens as the disciples are returning home from a mission trip.  The seventy-two disciples are rejoicing and elated.  They said to Jesus: “Lord, even the demons are subject to us because of your name.”  These disciples realized that it was not their power that enabled them to work wonders.  Rather, these wonders were wrought by the power of Jesus’ name.  However, Jesus cautions the disciples not to rejoice over their “power.”  Rather they should rejoice because their names are written in heaven.

Power is extremely seductive!  We often hear stories of “how the mighty have fallen” because they were seduced by power of money or control or perhaps by their lack of self-esteem.  Our human reality is that we all need a healthy sense of personal power.  We need to know that we do have a voice.  We need to know that we have the power to make decisions and that we also can influence others.  Yet if we are not mindful, our need for control or power may begin to control us!  We often hear stories of corrupted individuals who were seduced by power and the fruits of power.  Today Jesus instructs his disciples (us) to rejoice not because “spirits” are subject to us.  Rather we are to rejoice because our names are written in heaven!

Then Jesus cautions the disciples.  He tells them that they should not rejoice over the wondrous acts they performed.  Rather they should rejoice because their names are inscribed in heaven.  Jesus’ desire for his disciples is that they rejoice in God and in God’s love for them.  Rejoicing in God is to be their primary quest and their aim.  Today may we strive to be mindful of God’s love and presence with us!  Truly, there is no greater gift!  May we rejoice in this precious gift!
