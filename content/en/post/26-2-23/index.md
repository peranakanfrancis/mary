### Gospel
Then Jesus was led by the Spirit out into the desert to be put to the test by the devil. He fasted for forty days and forty nights, after which he was hungry, and the tester came and said to him, 'If you are Son of God, tell these stones to turn into loaves.' But he replied, 'Scripture says: Human beings live not on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.' The devil then took him to the holy city and set him on the parapet of the Temple. 'If you are Son of God,' he said, 'throw yourself down; for scripture says: He has given his angels orders about you, and they will carry you in their arms in case you trip over a stone.' Jesus said to him, 'Scripture also says: Do not put the Lord your God to the test.' Next, taking him to a very high mountain, the devil showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendour. And he said to him, 'I will give you all these, if you fall at my feet and do me homage.' Then Jesus replied, 'Away with you, Satan! For scripture says: The Lord your God is the one to whom you must do homage, him alone you must serve.' Then the devil left him, and suddenly angels appeared and looked after him.

### Reflection
“If You are the Son of God, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.” (Matthew 4:3).

Jesus, You trusted God to provide Your material needs. Help me to avoid placing my priorities on material things.

“If you are the Son of God, jump off! For the scriptures say, You would not even hurt Your foot on a stone.” (Matthew 4:6).

Jesus, You resisted using Your power for vain and foolish reasons. Help me to resist doing foolish things only to impress others.

“I will give it all to you, if you will kneel down and worship me.” (Matthew 4:9).

Jesus, You refused to cooperate with the devil. To achieve status and power.
Help me to refuse to cooperate with evil and injustice in achieving my goals in life.

“And do not let us yield to temptation, but rescue us from the evil one.” (Matthew 6:13).
