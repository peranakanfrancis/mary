> “Let all that I am praise the Lord. With my whole heart, I will praise His Holy Name. Let all that I am praise the Lord. May I never forget the good things He does for me.” Psalm 103: 1-2.

Praying our way through the day is equally as important as devoting set apart time to prayer. I believe God wants us to offer up acknowledgments of Him, make requests, and offer thanksgiving throughout each day. 

Learn to let prayer be as comfortable as breathing. Just think about how you would feel if your children said, “I love you, mom!” or “I love you, Dad!” Every time they walked by you. 

Just letting people know you think they are great is the kind of communication that develops relationships. 

When we treat the Lord Jesus Christ that way, our relationship with Him goes deeper and grows stronger, and we stay connected to Him through “Anytime, Anywhere“ Prayer. And He loves it.

### Prayer of Thanks
Lord Jesus Christ,
I love you, and I am thankful you love me too. I want to take every opportunity to tell you how wonderful you are and how blessed I am. Thank you that I can come to you in prayer anytime, anywhere.
