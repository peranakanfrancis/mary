### :love_letter: Gospel
> This is how Jesus Christ came to be born. His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph; but before they came to live together she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit. Her husband Joseph, being an upright man and wanting to spare her disgrace, decided to divorce her informally. He had made up his mind to do this when suddenly the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, 'Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because she has conceived what is in her by the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son and you must name him Jesus, because he is the one who is to save his people from their sins.' Now all this took place to fulfil what the Lord had spoken through the prophet: Look! the virgin is with child and will give birth to a son whom they will call Immanuel, a name which means 'God-is-with-us'. When Joseph woke up he did what the angel of the Lord had told him to do: he took his wife to his home.

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
People often think of religion as man’s search for God.

But the Gospel reading of today shows us that christianity is about God’s  search for us. We see this especially in the title bestowed on Jesus. Jesus is Emmanuel which means “God is with us” (Matthew 1:23).

God’s plan from the beginning of time has been to unite us to Him in a communion of Love.

After Adam and Eve sinned, they  “hid themselves from the Lord God” (Genesis 3:8), as they turned away from His Love.

The rest of Salvation History is the story of God ardently seeking us to heal this broken relationship and gradually restore His presence among us.

He first spoke to the great patriarchs such as Noah, Abraham and Jacob. He then appeared to Moses in the burning bush, guided the people of Israel by cloud and by fire, and revealed himself to them at Mount Sinai. In the era of the Davidic Monarchy, the God of all nations manifested himself uniquely among the Jewish people.

Through his presence in the Jerusalem Temple. The most direct and powerful manifestation of God’s  presence comes in the person Jesus Christ, who is God made man, the word who was made flesh and dwell among us (John 1:14).

God did not intend his presence to be encountered only by first century Jew living at the time of Jesus, “God is with us” desired to remain with us even after he ascended to the Father in Heaven.

Christ is present to us in His word, In His sacraments and “where two or three gather together as my followers, I am there among them” (Matthew 18:20).

In the scripture and the sacraments, we encounter the same Jesus who walked the streets of Palestine, two thousand years ago, teaching, healing and forgiving sins.

Through the sacraments and in the church, Jesus continues to be Emmanuel. He is with us always, “until the end of the age” (Matthew 28:20).

“Look! I stand at the door and knock. If you hear my voice and open the door, I will come in, and we will share a meal together as friends” (Revelation 3:20).

“Come to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest”. (Matthew 11:28).
