> David persisted “the Lord who rescued me from the claws of the lion and the bear will rescue me from this Philistine!”

Saul, finally consented “All right, go ahead,” he said, “and may the Lord be with you.” (1 Samuel 17:37).

If we remember the miracles God had done in the past with awe and a thankful heart, we will not so easily fall into worry and fear when we have new challenges to face.

When David was facing Goliath, he remembered the lion and the bear he had already slain with God’s help. Because he remembered what God had done, he had no fear of his situation with Goliath.

Are you facing something right now that looks like a giant in your life? If so, remember God’s goodness, be thankful for what he has done before, and choose to believe he can do it again.
Write down three things that God has done for you in the past and focus on them instead of your problem. Nothing is impossible for God, take some time to think about and talk about God’s miraculous work. Then you will find courage filling your heart.

### Prayer of Thanks
Lord Jesus Christ, with all my heart, I thank you, 
For the wonders you have done in the past.
And today, I stand in faith, believing that you will work
Mightily in my life once again.
Thank you for being the same yesterday, today and forever. Amen.

_Fr. Augustine Wong_
