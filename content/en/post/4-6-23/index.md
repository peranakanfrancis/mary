### PRAYER TO THE MOST HOLY TRINITY
O Most Holy Trinity, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. You are my Lord and my God. You are the God who walks with me, you hold my life in your hand. I entrust my life to your unfailing loving protection and care. Empower me to prosper and succeed in all I do.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,
And to the Holy Spirit as it was in the beginning,
Is now and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

___Fr. Augustine Wong___
