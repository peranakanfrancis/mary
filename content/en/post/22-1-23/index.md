*Then Jesus took them through the writings of Moses and all the prophets, explaining from all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself. (Luke 24:27).*

To celebrate the happy effects the Word of God has on our lives.

People do not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God. (Matthew 4:4).

All scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives. It corrects us when we are wrong and teaches us to do what is right. God uses it to prepare and equip his people to do every good work. (2 Timothy 3:16-17).

Your word is a lamp to guide my feet and a light for my path. (Psalm 119:105).

“I rise early, before the sun is up, I cry out for help and put my hope in your words.
I stay awake through the night thinking about your promise”. (In the Scriptures) 
(Psalm 119:147-148).

“Ignorance of the Scripture, is Ignorance of Christ.” (St. Jerome 347-419).
