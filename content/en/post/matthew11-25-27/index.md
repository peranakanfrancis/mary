### Gospel
> At that time Jesus said in reply, "I give praise to you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for although you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned you have revealed them to the childlike. Yes, Father, such has been your gracious will. All things have been handed over to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal him.

### Reflection
Today we eavesdrop on Jesus as he converses with his Father and Lord. Jesus is praising the goodness and graciousness of God for revealing to the “childlike” what is “hidden” rather than the “learned.” Ask yourself: how would you describe someone who is “child-like” (in the best sense of the word)? What are some of the characteristics these individuals possess? How do they approach life? Are they enjoyable to be around?

In our world, we esteem individuals who are learned and wise. And rightly so. However, there are many different kinds of wisdom. There is “learned” wisdom that comes from many years of study and learning. And there is “street-wisdom” that we learn in our ongoing encounters with other human beings. And there is the wisdom we learn from the daily living of the mystery of life. Do we appreciate and give thanks for the wisdom we have gleaned from life?

Jesus does not want us to be childish. Jesus desires that we be “child-like.” Ask yourself: what are the qualities of children that you wish to cultivate: innocence, trust, transparency? Or perhaps it is the ability to see beauty in the world? Or is it the inner freedom to simply “be who you are” or to be playful?

Today I invite to you be “child-like,” not childish. Allow your inner child to emerge! You may find that your day will be more relaxed, enjoyable and peaceful!
