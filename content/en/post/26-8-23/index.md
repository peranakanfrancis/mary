> When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who do people say the Son of Man is?” They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” “But what about you?” he asked. “Who do you say I am?” Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.” Jesus replied, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven. And I tell you that you are Peter,and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. 19 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loose in heaven.” 20 Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.

### Reflection
“who do you say that I am?” a small question that needs a big answer! Let us ponder and reflect: Is Christ to you a poetic idealist? Is he just a sentimental figure? Is he someone whose ideals are outdated in our changed world? Is he just a picture hanging on the church wall? Is he someone who can be found and studied in history books? Is he just an inspiring leader for social causes? Through your own life-witness and the values that you hold dear, what do you say to people who Christ is? How strong is your faith in Christ the master, the saviour of the world? Often the way we react to events and situations reveals the depth of our faith and our relationship with Jesus. Is my life a pointer to Christ?
Jesus means that the foundation of the church was to be this faith. Peter himself is like the first rock in God's building. Jesus is the foundation and God's building is the church. Peter was the first person to declare that he believed in Jesus and he became an important leader and teacher in the early.

YOUR’S IN CHRIST,
