### Marian prayer to our Lady
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Behold the handmaid of the Lord: Be it done unto me according to Thy word.

#### The parables of Tenants
The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone, this is the Lord’s doing and we are marvel at it? I tell you, then, The Kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a people who will produce its fruits.
The parable of the wicked tenants a God is eager to relate with humanity. The owner of the vineyard plans and prepares the vineyard with care. He repeatedly sends his servant’s the to the tenants in spite of their hostile reaction and goes to the extent of even sending his son. He desists from taking any hasty action lest the relationship be rupture. Unfortunately, the tenants, showing no interest in being related to their master, respond to his benevolence with ingratitude and rebellion. God enjoys a deep relationship with us. He loves to have a close bond with us. No wonder He came looking for Adam Eve who hid from Him after committing sin. He created us in his own image and in likeness so that we can relate with Him. This parable challenges all Christians to deepen our personal relationship with our loving Father. After all, Christianity is not essentially rational but relational.

YOURS IN CHRIST,
