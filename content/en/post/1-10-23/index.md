“They all met together and were constantly united in prayer, along with Mary the mother of Jesus.” (Acts 1:14).

At the great beginning of the church, Mary, the mother of Jesus, was at prayer. Praying with the disciples of Jesus, for herself and the disciples for the coming of the promised Holy Spirit.

“They all met together and were constantly united in prayer, along with Mary the mother of Jesus.” (Acts 1:14).
“Suddenly there was a sound from heaven like the roaring of a mighty windstorm, and it filled the house where they were sitting. Then what looked like flames or tongues of fire appeared and settled on each of them. And everyone present was filled with the holy spirit and began speaking in new languages as the holy spirit gave them this ability.” (Acts 2:2-4).

Since then, every generation of Christians have always call on Holy Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus Christ, to pray with them and for them in times of trouble, pain and anxiety. And was never left unaided.

Encourage by this thought, let us in this month of October, the month of the holy rosary, call on Holy Mary, mother of God, to pray with us and for us. In praying the rosary personally, as a family and in B.E.Cs.

With Holy Mary, mother of God, “Let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious God. There we will receive His mercy, and we will receive His mercy, and we will find grace to help us when we need it most.” (Hebrews 4:16).

Holy Mary, Mother of God, 
Pray with us and for us.
That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.

“My purpose is to give them a rich and satisfying life.” (John 10:10).
By “Doing whatever He tells you.” (John 2:5).
