### Gospel
> 1 At that time the disciples approached Jesus and said, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"

> 2 He called a child over, placed it in their midst,

> 3 and said, "Amen, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.

> 4 Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

### Reflection
Today the disciples approach Jesus with the question: “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” Jesus called a child into their midst. Then he gives the disciples an unexpected response to their question: “If you do not become like a child, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.” For Jesus, it is a person who is humble in the manner of a child (open, attentive, eager and loving), who will be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

Children are a great gift to us. They have the ability to teach us throughout our lives. Most adults think that children should imitate them. Yet, Jesus completely reverses this thought. We adults should strive to have the innocence, joy, frankness, and unconditional love that children naturally embody. I wonder how our lives would be different if we truly would follow the example of children?

I encourage you to try this for a few days. Then notice: Are you happier, joyful and more relaxed rather than stressed, worried or cranky? Be attentive to the children in your lives: we can learn a great deal from them. They are wise with the wisdom of the ages.
