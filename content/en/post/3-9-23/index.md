> When we celebrate the birthday of a person, we celebrate the goodness the person is to us. Likewise in celebrating the birthday of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we celebrate the wonder the Blessed Virgin Mary is to us.

1. “Why am I so honoured, that the mother of my Lord should visit me?” (Luke 1:43).

2. The wine supply ran out during the festivities, so Jesus’ mother told Jesus, they have no more wine. (John 2:3).

3. But His mother told the servants, “Do whatever He tells you.” (John 2:5).

4. “Standing near the cross were Jesus’ mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary (the wife of Clopas), and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother standing there beside the disciple he loved, He said to her, dear women, here is your son.” And He said to this disciple, here is your mother. ” And from then on, this disciple took her into his home.” (John 19:25 – 27).

### Prayer of  Thanks
Lord Jesus Christ,
We thank you with all our heart for giving us Mary, your dear mother to be our mother. She is so loving, so thoughtful, so understanding and so kind.
We thank you for her. 
Let us be known as her children by our way of living.
Amen.

On this day, O beautiful Mother.
On this day we give you, our love!
