title: Luke 11:42-46
subtitle: 'How would you react to such a public and scathing tongue lashing?  Jesus does not mince any words.  The reality is: we all have “a Pharisee” within us.  It naturally comes with our human condition.  The challenge for us is to recognize when our internal Pharisee is activated.  When we become aware that we are judging another, we then have the opportunity and choice to release our judgment.  If we can do this, we not only “release” the person we were prepared to judge, we also release ourselves.'

### Gospel
> 42 Woe to you Pharisees! You pay tithes of mint and of rue and of every garden herb, but you pay no attention to judgment and to love for God. These you should have done, without overlooking the others.

> 43 Woe to you Pharisees! You love the seat of honor in synagogues and greetings in marketplaces.

> 44 Woe to you! You are like unseen graves over which people unknowingly walk."

> 45 Then one of the scholars of the law said to him in reply, "Teacher, by saying this you are insulting us too."

> 46 And he said, "Woe also to you scholars of the law! You impose on people burdens hard to carry, but you yourselves do not lift one finger to touch them.

### Reflection:
This Gospel opens with attention-getting words.  Jesus scathingly says to the Pharisees: “Woe to you Pharisees!  You pay tithes of mint and rue but you pay no attention to judgment and love for God!”  What strong words!  And to make it worse, Jesus says this to the Pharisees in a public forum.

Jesus then accuses the Pharisees of enjoying “seats of honor in the synagogues and deferential greetings in the marketplace.”  He likens the Pharisees to unseen graves over which people unknowingly walk.   Finally, one of the scholars spoke up and said: “Teacher, you are insulting us.”  However, this does not stop Jesus.  He continues: “Woe to you scholars of the law.  You impose heavy burdens on the people that are difficult and painful.  Yet you do not lift a finger to touch them!”

Now take a moment and put yourself in the shoes of the Pharisees.  How would you react to such a public and scathing tongue lashing?  Jesus does not mince any words.  The reality is: we all have “a Pharisee” within us.  It naturally comes with our human condition.  The challenge for us is to recognize when our internal Pharisee is activated.  When we become aware that we are judging another, we then have the opportunity and choice to release our judgment.  If we can do this, we not only “release” the person we were prepared to judge, we also release ourselves.  And most likely, we may find that by not judging others, we are happier, more peaceful and more content.  Judgment will “poison” us if we do it frequently.  The choice is ours to make.  What will you (and I) choose today?
