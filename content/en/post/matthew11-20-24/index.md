### Gospel
> Then he began to reproach the towns where most of his mighty deeds had been done, since they had not repented. Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty deeds done in your midst had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would long ago have repented in sackcloth and ashes. But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you. And as for you, Capernaum: 'Will you be exalted to heaven? You will go down to the netherworld.' For if the mighty deeds done in your midst had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.

### Reflection
Today’s Gospel is a difficult one to read. Jesus’ instruction to his disciples is pretty disturbing Jesus denounces the cities of Chorazin and Bethsaida for refusing to believe in him despite the wonders they had seen him work. Jesus tells his disciples that he has not come to bring peace. Rather he has come to bring the sword. He also says that he has come to set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against a mother-in-law. I wonder if he also plans to do the same for father-in-laws and son-in-laws?

Clearly Jesus is furious with the people of Bethsaida and Chorazin. After seeing the wonders he had worked in their midst, it seems that they immediately should have repented. However, they did not! They simply went on about their evil deeds. Clearly, they were not interested in changing their lifestyle nor had any fear of God!

I wonder if Jesus is ever tempted to “denounce” us for not recognizing or appreciating the wonders he is working in our lives and in our world? It is so easy to become jaded. Do we see the many wonders Jesus is working in our world and our lives? Do we even look for them? Or are we so anesthetized with our daily routine that our minds, eyes and hearts are closed to the many wonders in our world? If so, how sad that is! There is so much goodness and beauty in people and in our world. However, we need to have open eyes, minds and hearts to truly see all this goodness!

Today, I invite you to keep your eyes and your heart open and awake. If we do so, we will see many “small” miracles and great beauty! What a wondrous gift to behold! Be alert! Be attentive!
