### Gospel
> What is your opinion? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine in the hills and go in search of the stray? And if he finds it, amen, I say to you, he rejoices more over it than over the ninety-nine that did not stray. In just the same way, it is not the will of your heavenly Father that one of these little ones be lost.

### Reflection
Jesus makes this statement after telling the parable of the one lost sheep.  The shepherd leaves the ninety-nine and goes searching diligently for that little one.  The parable goes on to state that, “If he finds it, amen, I say to you, he rejoices more over it than over the ninety-nine that did not stray” (Matthew 18:13).

We are all “one of these little ones.”  At first, it may seem unfair that the shepherd rejoices more over the one lost sheep than over the ninety-nine.  But if we understand that each and every one of us is that one lost sheep, it makes sense.

As we ponder this parable, it’s essential that we reflect upon the deep desire of the shepherd to find us.  We must look at his concern, his tireless effort and his diligence in seeking us out.  This is the care God has for you.

### Meditation
Reflect, today, upon you being that one lost sheep.  Being “lost” in our sin is not a pleasant experience.  Sin brings fear, despair, confusion, anger and the like.  But if we can turn our eyes to the Good Shepherd in the midst of our sinfulness, we will regain hope.  We will regain hope that our God cares for us so much that He will never stop searching for us.  And when He finds us, His heart will be filled with the greatest joy!

### Prayer
Lord, in the midst of my sinfulness and confusion I turn to You.  I trust that You will seek me out.  May I always trust in Your burning love for me.  Jesus, I trust in You.
