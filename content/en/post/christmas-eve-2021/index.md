### Gospel
> Then Zechariah his father, filled with the holy Spirit, prophesied, saying: “Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, for he has visited and brought redemption to his people. He has raised up a horn for our salvation within the house of David his servant, even as he promised through the mouth of his holy prophets from of old: salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us, to show mercy to our fathers and to be mindful of his holy covenant and of the oath he swore to Abraham our father, and to grant us that, rescued from the hand of enemies, without fear we might worship him in holiness and righteousness before him all our days. And you, child, will be called prophet of the Most High, for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways, to give his people knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins, because of the tender mercy of our God by which the daybreak from on high will visit us to shine on those who sit in darkness and death’s shadow, to guide our feet into the path of peace.”

### Reflection
This song of praise from Zechariah is spoken once his tongue is loosed after manifesting faith in the birth of his son John.  And in this particular song of praise, Zechariah gives glory to God as he manifests not only his faith, but also the fruit of his faith: deep, clear, articulate and insightful knowledge of the workings of the Father in Heaven.

Zechariah speaks truths that could only be known by him through the gift of faith.  There is little doubt that his long exile of silence, after being struck mute by the Angel Gabriel, resulted in him seeking, hearing and understanding the mystery that was before him.  He came to realize that his little child was the one who would prepare the immediate way for the Lord.  He came to understand this baby’s singular prophetic role in the salvation of the world.  He saw his son as the “dawn” which was to announce the rising Sun.

So much happened to Zechariah in these months of suffering.  The Lord worked on him and enabled him to offer this prayer of praise that is sung daily by priests and religious throughout the world.  Zechariah truly fulfilled his mission by getting back up on his feet after his fall.

The same must happen with each one of us.  It would have been easy for Zechariah to turn to anger and despair.  He could have easily lost hope and felt abandoned by God.  But he didn’t.  He waited on the fidelity of God and, when his time came, he spoke this beautiful and faith-filled song of praise.

### Meditation
Reflect, today, upon how God wants you to imitate the faith and perseverance of Zechariah.  It would be easy to look down on him for doubting.  But God did not do this.  Instead, He gave him a chance to honor Him through the ages with this song.  Seek the ways that God also wants to work through your failures of the past.  Offer them to Him and trust that He will manifest His almighty power through you as you seek to imitate the example of this holy man.

### Prayer
Lord, I offer You my past and all the ways that I have failed to trust in You.  I give You my weakness, my pride and my frustration.  I surrender all sin to You and give myself to You completely so that You may do with me as You will.  May Your grace be at work in me and may I, like Zechariah, sing forever the glory of Your holy name.  Jesus, I trust in You.
