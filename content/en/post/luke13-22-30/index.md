### Gospel
> 22 He passed through towns and villages, teaching as he went and making his way to Jerusalem.

> 23 Someone asked him, "Lord, will only a few people be saved?" He answered them,

> 24 "Strive to enter through the narrow gate, for many, I tell you, will attempt to enter but will not be strong enough.

> 25 After the master of the house has arisen and locked the door, then will you stand outside knocking and saying, 'Lord, open the door for us.' He will say to you in reply, 'I do not know where you are from.'

> 26 And you will say, 'We ate and drank in your company and you taught in our streets.'

> 27 Then he will say to you, 'I do not know where (you) are from. Depart from me, all you evildoers!'

> 28 And there will be wailing and grinding of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God and you yourselves cast out.

> 29 And people will come from the east and the west and from the north and the south and will recline at table in the kingdom of God.

> 30 For behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last."

### Reflection:
The Gospel today begins with someone in the crowd asking Jesus if only select people will be “saved.” In differing situations, we might hear conversation or homilies about “being saved.” Ask yourself: do you worry about “being saved?” If so, what is the source of your anxiety? From what does it stem? Does it come from not being perfect? Or do you worry about some choices you made in the past that were not good for you or for the people you love?

None of us is perfect — as we well know. We are far from it! The good news is Jesus gives us many more chances than we deserve. Jesus is the most loving and forgiving person who ever walked on the face of this earth. He knows that we are human. He knows that at times we will hurt others, berate ourselves, make poor choices, and maybe even turn away from Him for a time. Jesus knows this well and yet he continues to love us. He never stops inviting us to “come home.”

Jesus doesn’t ask us to be perfect. He simply wants us to come to him as we are. Do we trust his love for us? Jesus is waiting! What do we choose to do?
