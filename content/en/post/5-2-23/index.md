Once Jesus was in a certain place praying. As He finished, one of His disciples came to Him and said “Lord, teach us to pray.” (Luke 11:1).

Having noticed the happy effects of praying has on Jesus, “one of His disciples came to Him and said, “Lord, teach us to pray.” (Luke 11:1).

The “Lord, teach us to pray” (Luke 11:1) by His prayerful life and teaching:
Jesus often draws apart in solitude, on a mountain, preferably at night and early morning.

Jesus prays at decisive moments of His mission.
During His Baptism. (Luke 3:21).
During His Transfiguration. (Luke 9:28).
Before His own fulfilment of the Father’s plan of Love by His Death. (Luke 22:41-44).
Jesus also prays before decisive moments involving the mission of His apostles.
At His election and call of the twelve apostles. (Luke 6:12).
Before Peter’s confession of Him as “the Messiah sent from God”. (Luke 9:18-20).
That the faith of Peter may not fail when tempted. (Luke 22:32).

Jesus teaches about prayer:
(Luke 11:5-13) Keep on asking, and you will receive what you ask for.
(Luke 18:1-8) Should always pray and never give up.

Having noticed the importance of prayer and its happy effects on the life and work of Jesus. Let us give importance to prayer and its happy effects on our life and work.

Let us make efforts to pray. Learn more about prayer, praying and its happy effects on our life and work to live a happy new “rich and satisfying life”. (John 10:10).

Explicit prayer offered by Jesus before the raising of Lazarus.

“Father, thank you for hearing me. You always hear me, but I said it out loud for the sake of all these people standing here, so that they will believe you sent me”.

Then Jesus shouted “Lazarus, come out!”. (John 11:40-43).
