> “All of us, like sheep, have strayed away. We have left God’s paths to follow our own. Yet the Lord laid on him the sins of us all.” (Isaiah 53:6).

People’s foreheads are marked with ashes in the outline of a cross to the accompaniment of the words, “Remember, man, that you are dust and to dust will return”.

The words come from the story of the Fall (Genesis 3), and bring us down to earth, our misery.

“Then He said to the woman, I will sharpen the pain of your pregnancy, and in pain you will give birth. And you will desire to control your husband, but he will rule over you.” (Genesis 3:16).

“And to the man He said. Since you listened to your wife and ate from the tree, whose fruit I command you not to eat, the ground is cursed because of you. All your life you will struggle to scratch a living from it. It will grow thorns and thistles for you, though you will eat of its grains.

By the sweat of your brow will you have food to eat until you return to the ground from which you were made. For you were made from dust and to dust you will return: (Genesis 3:17-19).

But He was pierced for our rebellion, crushed for our sins.
He was beaten so we could be whole, He was whipped so we could be healed. (Isaiah 53:5).
