### :love_letter: Gospel
> Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me will never hunger, and whoever believes in me will never thirst. But I told you that although you have seen me, you do not believe. Everything that the Father gives me will come to me, and I will not reject anyone who comes to me, because I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of the one who sent me.

> And this is the will of the one who sent me, that I should not lose anything of what he gave me, but that I should raise it on the last day. For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in him may have eternal life, and I shall raise him on the last day.”

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
This little line says much about our Lord’s Divine Mercy.  It is a line repeated often in St. Faustina’s Diary of Divine Mercy and it’s a statement that many people need to hear.

Why is this important to hear?  Because, very often, we can carry the burden of rejection.  Without even realizing it, there are many who have experienced rejection in their life and, as a result, are afraid to be vulnerable in a relationship out of fear of being hurt.  Once you have been hurt in a relationship, you proceed with caution.  This hurt can come from a family member, spouse, friend or anyone we’ve tried to reach out to in love only to receive hurt and rejection.  And that hurts.

Jesus’ words are especially important because they help to reassure us that Jesus is trustworthy.  It is true that we can come to Him, open our hearts to Him, become completely vulnerable to Him, and He will treat us with the utmost tenderness, respect, kindness and care.  Jesus will treat us with more care than we even treat ourselves!

### :latin_cross: Meditation
Reflect upon these words of Jesus today.  Say them over and over.  “I will not reject anyone who comes to me.”  Know that He wants you to come to Him and to open your heart to Him completely.  Doing so will allow Him to manifest His love for you and enable you to trust Him beyond what you ever imagined possible.

### :pray: Prayer
My welcoming Lord, I want to come to You in my sufferings and rejection.  I know You are the Divine Healer and will bring comfort to my soul.  Help me to trust You and to let You love me.  Jesus, I trust in You.
