### THE ROSARY, A PLEDGE OF THE POWER OF GOD
	
In 1571, the Ottoman Turks attempted to cross the Mediterranean Sea to invade Europe.

Alarmed by it, Pope St. Pius V called on the Kings of Europe to unite to ward off the Islamic invasion.

And the Pope called on the Christian faithful to pray the Rosary, to invoke the Mother of God, help of Christians, for help.

On 7th October 1571 in the naval battle at Lepanto, the United Christian Navy defeated the Turks, warded of the Islamic intrusion into Europe.

On 7th October 1572, the anniversary of the Victorious Naval Battle at Lepanto, Pope St. Pius V, instituted the Feast of Our Lady of the Rosary.

With this historical background confidence in the power of the Rosary stands in the foreground of the Feast of Our Lady of the Rosary.

Encourage by this testimony, let us pray the rosary to come boldly to the throne of our gracious God. There we will receive his mercy, and we will find grace to help us when we need it most. (Hebrews 4:16).

The Rosary, a pledge of the power of God to prosper and succeed in all we do.

“Amen! Praise the Lord!” (Revelation 19:4).
