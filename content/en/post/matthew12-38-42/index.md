### Gospel
> Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to him, “Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you.” He said to them in reply, “An evil and unfaithful generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of Jonah the prophet. Just as Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights. At the judgment, the men of Nineveh will arise with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and there is something greater than Jonah here. At the judgment the queen of the south will arise with this generation and condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and there is something greater than Solomon here.

### Reflection
Today the Pharisees and scribes come to Jesus and say:  “We want to see a sign from you!” However, Jesus refuses to give them a sign.  He tells them that it is “an evil and unfaithful generation” that needs a “sign” in order to believe.  He then says: “No sign except the sign of Jonah will be given!”

How often do we ask Jesus for a sign of His love and presence?  Do we believe and trust in Jesus only when we receive a sign?  If we receive “a sign”, how do we know the sign is from Jesus?  I wonder if Jesus gets as aggravated with us as he did with the scribes and the Pharisees?  They wanted Jesus to prove himself.  Do we also need proof to believe and trust that Jesus is who he says he is?  Do we need proof to believe that Jesus is with us?

Today I invite you to ask yourself:  Who is Jesus to me?  How deep is my belief and trust in Jesus?  Do I wish to strengthen my relationship with Jesus?

How do we let Jesus know that we desire a deeper and more personal relationship with him?  Jesus is waiting for us!  Be attentive to the little signs you receive from Him.  He is with us.  Will we be open and notice His presence?
