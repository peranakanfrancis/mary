### :love_letter: Gospel
35. The next day as John stood there again with two of his disciples, Jesus went past,
36. and John looked towards him and said, 'Look, there is the lamb of God.'
37. And the two disciples heard what he said and followed Jesus.
38. Jesus turned round, saw them following and said, 'What do you want?' They answered, 'Rabbi' -- which means Teacher -- 'where do you live?'
39. He replied, 'Come and see'; so they went and saw where he lived, and stayed with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.
40. One of these two who became followers of Jesus after hearing what John had said was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter.
41. The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother and say to him, 'We have found the Messiah' -- which means the Christ-
42. and he took Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, 'You are Simon son of John; you are to be called Cephas' -- which means Rock.

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
At four o’clock on a spring afternoon Andrew met Jesus on a road in Galilee. Feeling that Andrew wished to linger long with Him and talk out his problems and his troubles. Jesus invited Andrew as a friend to his house.

So, Andrew “went with Jesus to the place where Jesus was staying and Andrew remained with Jesus the rest of the day.” (Luke 1:39)

In getting to know Jesus, Andrew discovered that Jesus is the long awaited Promised Messiah of Israel. The exciting discovery overwhelmed Andrew with great joy.

So, the first thing in the morning Andrew did was to find his brother and say to him, “we have found the Messiah,” which means the Christ. And he took Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said “you are Simon, Son of John, you are to be called Cephas, which means a rock” (John 1:41-42)

Andrew is the person who was always introducing others to Jesus.

In (John 6:8-9) Andrew brings to Jesus the boy with the five loaves and two small fishes. And in (John 12:20-22) Andrew brings the enquiring Greeks into the presence of Jesus.
It was Andrew’s great Joy to bring others to Jesus. He is the person with the Missionary Heart.

Having, Himself found the friendship of Jesus, Andrew spent all his life in introducing others to that friendship.

Andrew is our great example in that he could not keep Jesus to himself.
