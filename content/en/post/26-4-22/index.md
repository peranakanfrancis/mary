### :love_letter: Gospel
> Do not be amazed that I told you, ‘You must be born from above.’ The wind blows where it wills, and you can hear the sound it makes, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes; so it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.” Nicodemus answered and said to him, “How can this happen?” Jesus answered and said to him, “You are the teacher of Israel and you do not understand this? Amen, amen, I say to you, we speak of what we know and we testify to what we have seen, but you people do not accept our testimony. If I tell you about earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things? No one has gone up to heaven except the one who has come down from heaven, the Son of Man. And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.”

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
Do you sense the presence of the Holy Spirit in your life?  In this passage, Jesus offers an image of how the Holy Spirit works in us.  He analogizes the Holy Spirit to the wind.  We can hear the wind blowing but cannot see it.  We do, however, perceive the effects of the wind.  For example, when you see a tree swaying, you know that the wind is blowing.

So it is with the Holy Spirit in our lives.  Though we may not be able to tangibly perceive where the Holy Spirit comes from, we will be able to see the effects of the Spirit.  When we perceive a new strength within us, or an increase in virtues, or an ability to forgive, etc., we are aware of the fact that the Holy Spirit is present, leading us, transforming us and guiding us.

Additionally, we do not know where the wind goes once it passes.  So it is with the Holy Spirit.  If our lives are under the power and care of the Holy Spirit, we do not know where we will be led.  The Holy Spirit leads us in the moment but does not typically reveal our whole future.  We must be content to be led by the daily gentle presence of God, allowing ourselves to be moved here and there.  This requires much trust and abandonment.

### :latin_cross: Meditation
Reflect, today, upon the powerful presence of the Holy Spirit in your life.  Look for the effects of the Holy Spirit to discern whether or not you are being truly led by God.  Allow yourself to be led and moved by the Breath of God and anticipate great things in your life.  

### :pray: Prayer
Come Holy Spirit, renew within me the grace of my Baptism and lead me each and every day in accord with Your divine will.  I abandon myself to Your glorious care and trust in the promptings of Your presence in my life.  Jesus, I trust in You.
