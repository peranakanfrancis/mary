### Gospel
> 25 Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala.

> 26 When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple there whom he loved, he said to his mother, "Woman, behold, your son."

> 27 Then he said to the disciple, "Behold, your mother." And from that hour the disciple took her into his home.

### Reflection
Today is the memorial of “Our Lady of Sorrows.” This devotion to Mary dates from the 14th century. The Gospel today depicts Mary standing at the foot of the cross watching her son die a horrible death. How many parents and family members have stood “at the foot of the cross” watching someone they love die? Watching, waiting, knowing what the end will be but faithfully staying with the one they love, journeying with them to end.

Mary went through so much in her lifetime.  She had a visit from an angel announcing that she would give birth to a son even though she had never been with a man. What was it like when she had to face Joseph? She watched her son grow up and become a teacher. And she watched her son die a horrible death — and for what purpose? Mary never lost her faith and her trust in God. She must have questioned at times. (She was human.) Yet she must have had a very real, a very deep relationship with the God who called her.

At times, we also stand at the foot of the cross. How do I — how do we — respond? Do we trust that God is with us? Today may we ask Mary to grant us a share of her faith and her trust in God.
