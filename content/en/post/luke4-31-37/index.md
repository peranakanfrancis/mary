### Gospel
> 31 Jesus then went down to Capernaum, a town of Galilee. He taught them on the sabbath,

> 32 and they were astonished at his teaching because he spoke with authority.

> 33 In the synagogue there was a man with the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out in a loud voice,

> 34 "Ha! What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!"

> 35 Jesus rebuked him and said, "Be quiet! Come out of him!" Then the demon threw the man down in front of them and came out of him without doing him any harm.

> 36 They were all amazed and said to one another, "What is there about his word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out."

> 37 And news of him spread everywhere in the surrounding region.

### Reflection
Today Jesus traveled to the town of Capernaum in Galilee.  When he arrived there, Jesus taught the people.  His listeners were astounded at his teaching.  As they listened to him, they realized that Jesus was very different from any of the teachers they had heard before.  Jesus spoke with great authority, authenticity and yet with humility!

There was a man in the synagogue that was possessed by an unclean spirit.  When the man heard the people talk about Jesus and the astounding deeds he had done, the man cried out to him, saying: “What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth?  Are you here to destroy us?  I know that you are the Holy One of God.”  Jesus then rebuked the demon that possessed the man by saying: “Be quiet!  Come out of this man!”  In that moment, the demon threw the man to the floor and came out of the man’s body.

All the people who witnessed this healing were amazed and astounded. They said to one another: “What is it about this man?  Where did he get this authority?  How does he have the power to exorcise unclean spirits?”  The news of Jesus and His power and abilities spread throughout the region quickly. 

Now take a moment and ask yourself: What are the unclean spirits that possess you?  How do these unclean spirits affect your life and the people in your life?  Do you long to be freed from these unclean spirits or have they become an integral part of your life?  And perhaps more importantly, have you asked Jesus to exorcise the unclean spirits that may slowly be destroying your happiness and perhaps your life?

Today (and every day) come to Jesus and beg Him to rid you of any unclean spirit that is plaguing you or perhaps destroying your life. You may not receive an immediate miracle; however, you may begin to notice a difference in your life, in your emotions and in the quality of your trust in Jesus.  Jesus is with you!  Open your heart and trust Him!  He will not fail you!
