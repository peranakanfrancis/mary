### :love_letter: Gospel
> When he had said this, Jesus was deeply troubled and testified, “Amen, amen, I say to you, one of you will betray me.” The disciples looked at one another, at a loss as to whom he meant. One of his disciples, the one whom Jesus loved, was reclining at Jesus’ side. So Simon Peter nodded to him to find out whom he meant. He leaned back against Jesus’ chest and said to him, “Master, who is it?” Jesus answered, “It is the one to whom I hand the morsel after I have dipped it.” So he dipped the morsel and [took it and] handed it to Judas, son of Simon the Iscariot. After he took the morsel, Satan entered him. So Jesus said to him, “What you are going to do, do quickly.” [Now] none of those reclining at table realized why he said this to him. Some thought that since Judas kept the money bag, Jesus had told him, “Buy what we need for the feast,” or to give something to the poor. So he took the morsel and left at once. And it was night.

> When he had left, Jesus said,* “Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him. [If God is glorified in him,] God will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him at once. My children, I will be with you only a little while longer. You will look for me, and as I told the Jews, ‘Where I go you cannot come,’ so now I say it to you.

> Simon Peter said to him, “Master, where are you going?” Jesus answered [him], “Where I am going, you cannot follow me now, though you will follow later.” Peter said to him, “Master, why can’t I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.” Jesus answered, “Will you lay down your life for me? Amen, amen, I say to you, the cock will not crow before you deny me three times.”

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
It’s very important to note here that Jesus was “deeply troubled.”  This shows His humanity.  Jesus had a human heart and loved Judas with a divine love through His human heart.  As a result of this perfect love of Judas, Jesus’ heart was deeply troubled.  It was “troubled” in the sense that Jesus could do nothing more than He had already done to change the mind and heart of Judas.  It’s not that Jesus was personally offended or angered by Judas’ betrayal.  Rather, it’s that Jesus’ heart burned with a deep sorrow at the loss of Judas whom He loved with a perfect love.

Judas had free will.  Without free will Judas could not freely love Jesus.  But with free will, Judas chose to betray Jesus.  The same is true with us.
 We have free will and we are given the same ability that Judas had to accept the love of Jesus or to reject it.  We can let His loving gift of salvation and grace enter our lives or refuse it.  It’s 100% up to us.

Holy Week is an ideal time to seriously contemplate the road you are on.  Each and every day of your life you are invited by God to choose Him with all your might and love.  But, like Judas, we so often betray Him by our refusal to enter Holy Week with Jesus, embracing His Cross as ours.  We so often fail to give completely of our lives in a sacrificial and generous way, as our Lord did that Holy Week.  

### :latin_cross: Meditation
Reflect, today, upon the love Jesus had for Judas.  It was His love for Judas, more than Judas’ sin, that brought so much pain to Jesus’ Heart.  If Jesus didn’t love him, the rejection would not have hurt.  Reflect, also, on the love Jesus has for you.  Ponder whether or not His Heart is also troubled as a result of the actions in your life.  Be honest and do not make excuses.  If Jesus is troubled in any way as a result of your actions and choices this is no reason to despair as Judas did.  Rather, it should be the cause of rejoicing that you are aware of your weakness, sin and limitation.

Turn that over to Jesus who loves you more than you love yourself.  Doing this will bring your heart much consolation and peace.  And it will also bring much consolation and peace to the Heart of our Divine Lord.  He loves you and is waiting for you to come to Him this Holy Week.

### :pray: Prayer
My dear suffering and rejected Lord, I do love You but I also know that I cause Your Heart to be troubled by my betrayal.  Help me to see my sin honestly this Holy Week.  In seeing it, may I let go of that which keeps me from loving You more deeply, so as to walk with You to the Cross to share in Your glorious triumph.  Jesus, I trust in You.
