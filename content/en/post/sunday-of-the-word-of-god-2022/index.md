title: 'The Gift of Sacred Scripture | Luke 1:1-4,  4:14-21'
subtitle: Since many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the events that have been fulfilled among us, just as those who were eyewitnesses from the beginning and ministers of the word have handed them down to us, I too have decided, after investigating everything accurately anew, to write it down in an orderly sequence for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may realize the certainty of the teachings you have received.  Luke 1:1-4.

> Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news of him spread* throughout the whole region. He taught in their synagogues and was praised by all.

> He came to Nazareth, where he had grown up, and went according to his custom into the synagogue on the sabbath day. He stood up to read and was handed a scroll of the prophet Isaiah. He unrolled the scroll and found the passage where it was written:

> “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring glad tidings to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free, and to proclaim a year acceptable to the Lord.”

> Rolling up the scroll, he handed it back to the attendant and sat down, and the eyes of all in the synagogue looked intently at him. He said to them, “Today this scripture passage is fulfilled in your hearing.”

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
St. Luke begins his Gospel with this short explanation.  This introduction to his Gospel gives us the opportunity to look more deeply at the Holy Bible.

What is your approach to the Bible?  How often do you read it?  How thoroughly do you understand it?  Is the Bible the foundation of your life of faith and knowledge of God?  

Sacred Scripture is a gift beyond our imagination.  It’s a gift from God through which He reveals His perfect love and His perfect plan for us.  We should know the Scriptures well, read them often, pray over the verses and allow all that is revealed within those pages to become the foundation of our lives.  Let’s reflect upon one particular aspect of Sacred Scripture.

The Bible is 100% the work of God and 100% the work of the human author.  It is 100/100 so to speak.  This means that the human author completely cooperated with the inspiration of the Holy Spirit in writing each book and letter.  And God, for His part, guaranteed that all that was written came from His heart and inspiration.  Therefore, this joint effort reveals that God used the human author for a divine purpose.

This is of great significance to understand for two reasons.  First, it reveals that we should love Scripture because it reveals the heart and truth of God as well as the unique personality and humanity of the human author.  So we are benefiting from the full revelation of God as well as the unique gift of the human author.

Second, it should reveal to us that, though God will not use us in the same way (i.e., to add to the Bible), He does desire to use us for divine purposes.  He desires to consume our unique human personality and use us to shine forth the beauty and splendor of His divinity.  He wants a 100/100 cooperation with us, also, so as to shine through us in a radiant way.

### :latin_cross: Meditation
Reflect, today, upon two things.  First, reflect upon the gift of the Bible and the way that God used the human author to give you this gift.  Second, reflect upon the fact that God wants to use you, in all your weakness and sin, to bring His divine presence into our world.  Be open to that gift so that you may become a living gift of the Word of God to the world.

### :pray: Prayer
Most glorious Eternal Word, I thank You for the wonderful gift of Sacred Scripture.  Thank You for all that You have revealed through this gift and for the way that You used the human author for the transmission of Your life.  Help me to always be open to Your divine Word and to always be open to becoming a living presence of that Word in our world.  Jesus, I trust in You.
