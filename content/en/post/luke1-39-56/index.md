### Gospel
> 39 During those days Mary set out and traveled to the hill country in haste to a town of Judah,

> 40 where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.

> 41 When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the infant leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth, filled with the holy Spirit,

> 42 cried out in a loud voice and said, "Most blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.

> 43 And how does this happen to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?

> 44 For at the moment the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy.

> 45 Blessed are you who believed that what was spoken to you by the Lord would be fulfilled."

> 46 And Mary said: "My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord;

> 47 my spirit rejoices in God my savior.

> 48 For he has looked upon his handmaid's lowliness; behold, from now on will all ages call me blessed.

> 49 The Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is his name.

> 50 His mercy is from age to age to those who fear him.

> 51 He has shown might with his arm, dispersed the arrogant of mind and heart.

> 52 He has thrown down the rulers from their thrones but lifted up the lowly.

> 53 The hungry he has filled with good things; the rich he has sent away empty.

> 54 He has helped Israel his servant, remembering his mercy,

> 55 according to his promise to our fathers, to Abraham and to his descendants forever."

> 56 Mary remained with her about three months and then returned to her home.


### Reflection
The Gospel reading for this feast is a very familiar one. Mary is traveling to visit her cousin, Elizabeth. Mary had just had a visit from an unexpected and unsettling experience. She had a visitor come to her: an angel! As we know, the angel announced to Mary that she would have a child even though she was a virgin. The angel had also told her a fantastic tale. She was to have a child who would be great and he would be called “the Son of the Most High.”

Mary was confused, afraid and reeling after this encounter. She didn’t know what to make of it and she desperately needed to talk with someone she trusted: a person who would take her seriously and listen to her tale. Thus, she decided to go and visit Elizabeth. After all, Elizabeth also had had a very unusual experience: she found that she was with child even though she was far beyond the age of having children. Perhaps Elizabeth could help Mary make sense of all that was happening in her life. Mary must have been very confused and frightened. What would her parents think? What would the townspeople think when they realized that she was pregnant? Imagine the riot of emotions that were in Mary’s mind and heart!

Now, I invite you to remember a time in your life when you had an experience that was unsettling, frightening, confusing, and created difficulties for you. What was your response? What did you do? Who did you depend on? Did you go to a wise person whom you trusted? Someone you knew would listen to you and walk with you during this difficult time? Someone who could give you good advice and would support you every step of the way?

At various moments in our lives, we all will need an “Elizabeth” (who may be male or female). Take a moment to remember the “Elizabeths” in your life. Who were they? What was the impact they had on you?

Now take a few moments and give thanks for these loving and caring individuals. Ask God to bless them! And perhaps you may want to thank them in some way for being there when you needed them. And at some point, you can be an “Elizabeth” to another person!
