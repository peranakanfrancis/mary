### 2 peter 1:16-19
> When we told you about the power and the coming of our lord Jesus Christ. We were not slavishly repeating invented myths; no, we had seen his majesty with our own eyes. He was honored and glorified by God the Father, when a voice came to him from the transcendent glory,” This is my son, the beloved; he enjoys my favour. we ourselves heard this voice from heaven, when we were with him on the holy mountain, so we have confirmation of the words of the prophets; and you will be right to pay attention to it as to a lamp for lighting a way through the dark, until the dawn comes and the morning star rises in your minds.

### Reflection
Jesus is a man of Prayer. Most probably He has many mystical experiences of god during such times. Here He shares a very special mystical experience with a close disciple. We join Christ in this journey to the mountain. If we are faithful to a daily time of personal prayer, we speak to God in trust, but we also listen to him. Deep prayer times are like climbing to the top of a mountain. As we trek up daily, we may enjoy the trip sometimes, but otherwise find it hard, tiring and monotonous. Yet when we persevere in prayer, God will suddenly choose to reveal Himself to us. This is a deep personal prayer experience- the most wonderful of human experiences. Our heavenly father reveals his son Jesus to us in those times: “This is My son, the Beloved, He enjoys My favour,” have I heard this inner voice any time? Am I open to listening to and following Christ, the beloved son of the father?

“Mission makes us vulnerable, this is beautiful, that mission makes us vulnerable. It helps remind us that we are disciples and it makes us rediscover ever anew the Joy of the Gospel.” (Pope Francis)

“God loves humanity; that is why he addresses his word to them, and why he “inclines his ear” to listen to them. (pope Francis)

Your’s in Christ,
