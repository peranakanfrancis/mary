> “Then I witnessed in heaven an event of great significance. I saw a woman clothed with the Sun, with the moon beneath Her feet, and a crown of twelve stars on her head.” Revelation 12:1.

“The most Blessed Virgin Mary, when the course of Her earthly life was completed, was taken up body and soul into the glory of heaven, where She already shares in the Glory of Her son’s resurrection, anticipating the resurrection of all members of His body.” Catechism of the Catholic church No. 974.

Mary, taken up in body and soul into complete communion with God in heaven reveal to us the end God has called all human beings. The fulfilment of “A rich and satisfying life” John 10:10 with God complete in body and soul in heaven.

On the feast of The Bodily Assumption of Mary into heaven, we proclaim our faith that Jesus Christ has come so that we might have life and it more abundantly in “A rich and satisfying life.” John 10:10.

### Prayer Petition
All powerful and merciful God and Father. You did great things for the Virgin Mary. And brought Her body and soul, to the glory of heaven. 
To a fulfilled rich and satisfying life, body and soul with you. 
Do great thing for me. Equip me with the gifts and power of the Holy Spirit. To empower me to “prosper and succeed in all I do” Joshua 1:8.
To live “A rich and satisfying life.” John 10:10.
Let me be known as the son/daughter of Mary by my way of living, “Keep the commandments of God and bear testimony to Jesus.”
Amen. Revelation 12:17.
Pray for me, most Holy Mother of God
That I may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.
“My purpose is to give them a rich and satisfying.” John 10:10.
“And the dragon was angry at the woman and declared war against the rest of her children, all who keep God’s commandments and maintain their testimony for Jesus.” Revelation12:17.
