### :love_letter: Gospel
> He said, “This is how it is with the kingdom of God; it is as if a man were to scatter seed on the land and would sleep and rise night and day and the seed would sprout and grow, he knows not how. Of its own accord the land yields fruit, first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. And when the grain is ripe, he wields the sickle at once, for the harvest has come.”

> He said, “To what shall we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable can we use for it? It is like a mustard seed that, when it is sown in the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on the earth. But once it is sown, it springs up and becomes the largest of plants and puts forth large branches, so that the birds of the sky can dwell in its shade.”

> With many such parables he spoke the word to them as they were able to understand it. Without parables he did not speak to them, but to his own disciples he explained everything in private.

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
It is amazing to think about.  This tiny seed has so much potential.  That little seed has within it the potential to become the largest of plants, a source of food, and a dwelling place for the birds of the air.

Perhaps this analogy that Jesus uses does not impress us as much as it should because we know that all plants begin with a seed.  But try to think about this wonder of the physical world.  Try to think about how so much potential is packed into that little seed.

This reality reveals the fact that Jesus wants to use each one of us for the building up of His Kingdom.  We may feel as though we cannot do much, that we are not as gifted as others, that we will not be able to make much of a difference, but that’s not true.  The truth is that each one of us is packed with unbelievable potential that God wants to bring to fruition.  He wants to bring forth from our lives glorious blessings for the world.  All we must do is allow Him to work.

Like a seed, we must allow ourselves to be planted in the fertile soil of His mercy through faith and surrender to His divine will.  We must be watered by daily prayer and allow the rays of the Son of God to shine on us so that He can bring forth from us all that He desires and has planted from the foundation of the world.  

### :latin_cross: Meditation
Reflect, today, upon the incredible potential that God has placed within your soul.  He made you with the intention to bring forth His Kingdom through you and to do so in an abundant way.  It is your responsibility to simply believe this and to allow God to do what He desires to do in your life.

### :pray: Prayer
Lord of unending potential, I love You and thank You for all that You have done in my life.  I thank You, in advance, for all that You still desire of me.  I pray that I may daily surrender to You so that You can come and nourish me with Your grace, bringing forth from my life an abundance of good fruit.  Jesus, I trust in You.
