> Psalms 94: 19 “when the cares of my heart are many, your consolations cheer my soul. When doubts filled my mind, your comfort gave me renewed hope and cheer. When I was upset and beside myself, you calmed me down and cheered me up”.

Overcoming worry, start from relying on god. No one wants to be worried all day. We all want to live freely with no worries about anything. But as we face various pressures that life brings us, few can live easily and happily.

They don’t know what they will encounter that day. That is unknown, but we don’t fear the unknown. Why is that? Because we have God. We have God in our hearts. We have something to lean on. So, no matter what issues we encounter, we’re not afraid; we have something to lean on and we are motivated. We’re not like non-believers, they are helpless, they’re constantly running around, and they’re constantly afraid of what might happen. We don’t need to fear those things, God is supreme, he is our Lord, we can lean on Him, He is our Rock. God has already told us the principles of what we should practice when we encounter an issue. We live our lives in the light, in peace.

This verse promises that God gives us comfort and is fighting for us during our surmounting fears. Christ is our light in the darkness, no matter what form that darkness might take.

### PSALMs 94: 20-23 
“shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which farmed mischief by law. They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood. But the Lord is my defence; and my God is Rock of my refuge. And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the lord our god shall cut them off.”

YOURS IN CHRIST,
