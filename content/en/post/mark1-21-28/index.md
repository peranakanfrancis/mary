### :love_letter: Gospel
> Then they came to Capernaum, and on the sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught. The people were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes.

> In their synagogue was a man with an unclean spirit; he cried out, “What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!” Jesus rebuked him and said, “Quiet! Come out of him!” The unclean spirit convulsed him and with a loud cry came out of him.

> All were amazed and asked one another, “What is this? A new teaching with authority. He commands even the unclean spirits and they obey him.” His fame spread everywhere throughout the whole region of Galilee.

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
As we enter into this First Week in Ordinary Time, we are given the image of Jesus teaching in the synagogue.  And as He teaches, it’s clear that there is something special about Him.  He is one who teaches with a new authority.  

This statement in Mark’s Gospel contrasts Jesus with the scribes who apparently teach without this unmistakable authority.  This statement should not go unnoticed.

Jesus exercised His authority in His teaching not so much because He wanted to, but because He had to.  This is who He is.  He is God and when He speaks He speaks with the authority of God.  He speaks in such a way that people know His words have transforming meaning.  His words effect change in people’s lives.  

This should invite each one of us to reflect upon the authority of Jesus in our lives.  Do you notice His authority spoken to you?  Do you see His words, spoken in Sacred Scripture, having an effect upon your life?  

### :latin_cross: Meditation
Reflect, today, upon this image of Jesus teaching in the synagogue.  Know that the “synagogue” represents your own soul and that Jesus desires to be there speaking to you with authority.  Let His words sink in and change your life.

### :pray: Prayer
My authoritative Lord, I open myself to You and Your voice of authority.  Help me to allow You to speak with clarity and truth.  As You do, help me to be open to allowing You to change my life.  Jesus, I trust in You.
