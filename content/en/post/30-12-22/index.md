### :love_letter: Gospel
> After they had left, suddenly the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, 'Get up, take the child and his mother with you, and escape into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, because Herod intends to search for the child and do away with him.' So Joseph got up and, taking the child and his mother with him, left that night for Egypt, where he stayed until Herod was dead. This was to fulfil what the Lord had spoken through the prophet: I called my son out of Egypt. After Herod's death, suddenly the angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt and said, 'Get up, take the child and his mother with you and go back to the land of Israel, for those who wanted to kill the child are dead.' So Joseph got up and, taking the child and his mother with him, went back to the land of Israel. But when he learnt that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod as ruler of Judaea he was afraid to go there, and being warned in a dream he withdrew to the region of Galilee. There he settled in a town called Nazareth. In this way the words spoken through the prophets were to be fulfilled: He will be called a Nazarene.

“My Child, support your Father in his old age, do not grieve him during his life. Even if his mind should fail, show him sympathy, do not despise him in your health and strength. For kindness to a Father will not be forgotten. But will serve as reparation for your sins.” (Ecclesiasticus 3:12-14).

“Wives, submit to your husband, as is fitting for those who belong to the Lord.
Husbands, love your wives and never treat them harshly.
Children, always obey your parents, for this pleases the Lord.
Fathers, do not aggravate your children, or they will become discouraged.” (Colossians 3:18-21).

“Fathers, can give their sons an inheritance of houses and wealth, but only the Lord can give an understanding wife.” (Proverbs 19:14).
