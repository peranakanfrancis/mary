### :love_letter: Gospel
> As you go, make this proclamation: ‘The kingdom of heaven is at hand.’ Cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, drive out demons. Without cost you have received; without cost you are to give.

> Do not take gold or silver or copper for your belts; no sack for the journey, or a second tunic, or sandals, or walking stick. The laborer deserves his keep. Whatever town or village you enter, look for a worthy person in it, and stay there until you leave. As you enter a house, wish it peace. If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; if not, let your peace return to you.

> Whoever will not receive you or listen to your words—go outside that house or town and shake the dust from your feet. Amen, I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
What is the cost of the Gospel?  Can we put a price on it?  Interestingly, we should put two prices on it.  The first price is how much it should cost us to receive it.  The second price is how much we “charge,” so to speak, to give the Gospel.

So how much should the Gospel cost us?  The answer is that it’s of infinite value.  We could never afford it monetarily speaking.  The Gospel is priceless.

As far as how much we should “charge” to give the Gospel to others, the answer is that it’s free.  We have no right to charge or expect anything so as to give away something that we do not own.  The saving message of the Gospel belongs to Christ and He offers it freely.

Let’s start with the second half of the Scripture above.  “Without cost you are to give.”  This tells us that we are to offer the Gospel to others free of charge.  But this action of freely giving the Gospel brings with it a sort of hidden requirement.  The giving of the Gospel requires that we give of ourselves.  And that means we must give of ourselves freely.  What’s the justification for giving everything of ourselves freely?  The justification is that we have received everything “without cost.”  

The simple fact is that the Gospel is all about a total free gift to us which requires a total free gift of ourselves to others.  The Gospel is a person, Jesus Christ.  And when He comes and lives in us freely, we must then become a total and free gift to others.

### :latin_cross: Meditation
Reflect, today, on both your complete receptivity of the Gospel as well as your complete willingness to give.  May your understanding and reception of this glorious gift of God transform you into a gift for others.

### :pray: Prayer
My priceless Lord, may my heart be open to You in a total way so that I may receive You as the Living Gospel.  As I receive You, may I in turn give You to others in my very person.  Jesus, I trust in You.
