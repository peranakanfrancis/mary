### Gospel
> 21 Then Peter approaching asked him, "Lord, if my brother sins against me, how often must I forgive him? As many as seven times?"

> 22 Jesus answered, "I say to you, not seven times but seventy-seven times.

> 23 That is why the kingdom of heaven may be likened to a king who decided to settle accounts with his servants.

> 24 When he began the accounting, a debtor was brought before him who owed him a huge amount.

> 25 Since he had no way of paying it back, his master ordered him to be sold, along with his wife, his children, and all his property, in payment of the debt.

> 26 At that, the servant fell down, did him homage, and said, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay you back in full.'

> 27 Moved with compassion the master of that servant let him go and forgave him the loan.

> 28 When that servant had left, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a much smaller amount. He seized him and started to choke him, demanding, 'Pay back what you owe.'

> 29 Falling to his knees, his fellow servant begged him, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay you back.'

> 30 But he refused. Instead, he had him put in prison until he paid back the debt.

> 31 Now when his fellow servants saw what had happened, they were deeply disturbed, and went to their master and reported the whole affair.

> 32 His master summoned him and said to him, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you your entire debt because you begged me to.

> 33 Should you not have had pity on your fellow servant, as I had pity on you?'

> 34 Then in anger his master handed him over to the torturers until he should pay back the whole debt.

> 35 So will my heavenly Father do to you, unless each of you forgives his brother from his heart."

> 1 When Jesus finished these words, he left Galilee and went to the district of Judea across the Jordan.


### Reflection
Today Jesus continues the dialogue he began in yesterday’s Gospel reading. Peter comes to Jesus wanting some concrete answers. Peter asks Jesus: “If someone sins against me, how many times do I have to forgive them? Is seven times enough?” Jesus must have blown Peter away with his answer. He looked at Peter and says: “I say to you, not seven times but seventy times.” Wouldn’t you have loved to see the look on Peter’s face when he heard Jesus’ answer?

I assume all of us have been in Peter’s shoes, needing to forgive another person for the frustration, pain or anguish they may have caused us. And we feel “sinned against.” When someone sins against us, do we respond as Jesus calls us to do? Do we nurse a grudge? Or do we give the individual the silent treatment? Or perhaps we tend to blow up. Or do we immediately forgive the person? The reality is that we may not be able to immediately forgive the offender. Some sins against us are simply too painful, traumatic or demeaning. These sins may take decades to completely forgive.

Forgiveness is first and foremost a decision. Following the decision to forgive is the process of forgiving. Minor offenses may be forgiven more easily and immediately. However, some sins against us may take months or even years before we are able to completely forgive the person who wounded us. The first step is the biggest step: to make the choice to forgive. However, if we expect the hurt, anger and disappointment to immediately dissipate, most likely we will be deeply disappointed in ourselves as well as frustrated. Once we take this first step of deciding to forgive, we may experience more freedom, peace and joy. In this process, we not only “release” the offender, we also release ourselves!

Today examine your relationships and ask yourself: whom do I need to forgive? Am I willing to forgive? If the answer is yes, ask God to give you the grace you need to free the other person and yourself! God will grace you with an open and free heart!
