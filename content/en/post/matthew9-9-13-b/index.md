### Gospel
> 9 As Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the customs post. He said to him, "Follow me." And he got up and followed him.

> 10 While he was at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat with Jesus and his disciples.

> 11 The Pharisees saw this and said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"

> 12 He heard this and said, "Those who are well do not need a physician, but the sick do.

> 13 Go and learn the meaning of the words, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' I did not come to call the righteous but sinners."

### Reflection
Today we celebrate the feast of St. Matthew. The Gospel reading for today is “the call of Matthew.” Jesus saw Matthew as he walked by Matthew’s custom post. Jesus simply said to Matthew, “follow me,” and immediately, Matthew got up and followed Jesus.

Matthew then invited Jesus and the disciples to his home to share a meal. Many tax collectors and sinners also were invited to the meal and sat in the midst of Jesus and his disciples. When the Pharisees saw this, they were scandalized. They asked Jesus’ disciples: “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” However, the disciples did not have a chance to respond to the question. Jesus had heard their question and said: “Those who are well do not have need of a physician, the sick do. Go and learn the meaning of the words: I desire mercy, not sacrifice!” Jesus continues: “I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”

Pope Francis is a wonderful example in our day of a man who truly follows in Jesus’ footsteps. He reaches out to the poor, the needy and disenfranchised. He is a man who embodies the grace of joy. Joy simply flows out from his being. Today Jesus is calling us to follow him. Will we follow him with a joyful and merciful heart? Today’s world is in desperate need of joy and mercy! If we share our joy and mercy with others today, we may find that joy and mercy will return to us 100-fold!
