### Gospel
> 1 He said to his disciples, "Things that cause sin will inevitably occur, but woe to the person through whom they occur.

> 2 It would be better for him if a millstone were put around his neck and he be thrown into the sea than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin.

> 3 Be on your guard! If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.

> 4 And if he wrongs you seven times in one day and returns to you seven times saying, 'I am sorry,' you should forgive him."

> 5 And the apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith."

> 6 The Lord replied, "If you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you would say to (this) mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it would obey you.

### Reflection:
Todayâ€™s Gospel begins with Jesus again teaching his disciples. He tells his disciples that it is inevitable that sin will occur. However, he warns the disciples not to do anything that would cause scandal to another person or tempt an individual to sin. To Jesus, this is one of the worst things we can do.

Jesus tells his disciples to be on their guard. They need to be mindful of what they do as well as what they say. Our words and actions will have a positive impact or a negative impact on others. Jesus is reminding us to be conscious and aware of our words, our attitudes, and our actions. Today we have the potential to be a positive influence or a negative influence! What will be our choice?
