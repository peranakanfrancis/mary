### Gospel
> 14 He was driving out a demon (that was) mute, and when the demon had gone out, the mute person spoke and the crowds were amazed.

> 15 Some of them said, "By the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons, he drives out demons."

> 16 Others, to test him, asked him for a sign from heaven.

> 17 But he knew their thoughts and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be laid waste and house will fall against house.

> 18 And if Satan is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that it is by Beelzebul that I drive out demons.

> 19 If I, then, drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your own people drive them out? Therefore they will be your judges.

> 20 But if it is by the finger of God that (I) drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.

> 21 When a strong man fully armed guards his palace, his possessions are safe.

> 22 But when one stronger than he attacks and overcomes him, he takes away the armor on which he relied and distributes the spoils.

> 22 But when one stronger than he attacks and overcomes him, he takes away the armor on which he relied and distributes the spoils.

> 24 "When an unclean spirit goes out of someone, it roams through arid regions searching for rest but, finding none, it says, 'I shall return to my home from which I came.'

> 25 But upon returning, it finds it swept clean and put in order.

> 26 Then it goes and brings back seven other spirits more wicked than itself who move in and dwell there, and the last condition of that person is worse than the first."

### Reflection:
This Gospel begins with Jesus once again “driving out a demon.”  Some of the individuals who witnessed Jesus’ power to drive out demons were critical and suspicious of him.  They accused Jesus of driving out demons by the power of Beelzebub.  There also were other unbelievers in the crowd who wanted to test Jesus.  So they asked him to give them a sign from heaven.  However, Jesus knew their thoughts and their motivation.  He realized that they were testing him.

Most likely Jesus’ reply was not the answer they expected or hoped for.  Jesus tells them: “Every kingdom divided against itself will be laid waste.  And house will fall upon house.”  Then he asks: “If Satan is divided against himself, will his kingdom stand?”  Jesus continued, saying: “Some of your members also drive out demons! From whom do they get their power?”  Jesus’ questioners did not answer him.

Ask yourself: what are your demons?  We all have them.  No one is exempt.  When we read the daily newspaper we may read stories of individuals who were driven by demons.  Perhaps they broke into a house and stole several items.  Or perhaps it is the story of a child, woman or man being abused.  Or the headline of the evening news may be on the never-ending fighting in the Middle East.

Our human reality is: we all have our own personal demons.  Ask yourself: what are my demons? Can you name them without pausing?  Or do you have to sit and think about it?  No human being is exempt from demons, not even the saints.  However, the saints testify to us that with God, Jesus or the Holy Spirit in our lives, with the grace they gift us with, we can control our demons.  And hopefully over time with God’s grace, we may be able to “dis-empower” our demons.  Most likely they will not completely disappear from our lives.  However, we will be better able to recognize them and control them, rather than our demons controlling us.

And with our more powerful demons, only the grace of God or Jesus’ grace will do.  Today be attentive to your demons. Take your demons to Jesus! He will drive them out!
