### Gospel
> 46 They came to Jericho. And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a sizable crowd, Bartimaeus, a blind man, the son of Timaeus, sat by the roadside begging.

> 47 On hearing that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, "Jesus, son of David, have pity on me."

> 48 And many rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he kept calling out all the more, "Son of David, have pity on me."

> 49 Jesus stopped and said, "Call him." So they called the blind man, saying to him, "Take courage; get up, he is calling you."

> 50 He threw aside his cloak, sprang up, and came to Jesus.

> 51 Jesus said to him in reply, "What do you want me to do for you?" The blind man replied to him, "Master, I want to see."

> 52 Jesus told him, "Go your way; your faith has saved you." Immediately he received his sight and followed him on the way.

### Reflection
On this 30th Sunday of Ordinary Time, we hear the story of Bartimaeus, the blind man.  As Jesus was leaving Jericho, Bartimaeus was sitting on the roadside begging for alms.  When Bartimaeus realized that Jesus was passing by, he cried out to him: “Jesus, Son of David, have pity on me!”  The people around Bartimaeus tried to silence him.  However, Bartimaeus was determined to get Jesus’ attention.  He continued to cry out: “Jesus, Son of David, have pity on me!”

When Jesus heard Bartimaeus’ plea, he stopped and said to his disciples: “Call him.”  The disciples called to Bartimaeus: “Take courage and get up!  Jesus is calling you!”  Immediately, Bartimaeus jumped up, threw his cloak aside and went to Jesus.  Jesus quietly  asked him: “What do you want me to do for you?”  Bartimaeus replied: “Master, I want to see.”  Jesus then said to him: “Go on your way; your faith has saved you.”  And in that instant, Bartimaeus received his sight and he followed Jesus on the way.

Ask yourself:  What is the “sight” that you wish to ask Jesus for today?  What is it that you need to see?  Then be attentive throughout the day.  Jesus may give you your “sight” in an unexpected or unusual way.  Be attentive to each person you encounter.  Truly look at each person.  They may appreciate a few minutes of your time and attention.  Or perhaps they simply need some recognition that you have “seen” them.

And today give thanks for the people who notice and “see” you.  They have given you a great gift.  In return, share this small but loving gift with others!
