The faith of a Canaanite woman who cried out “Lord, son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is demon-possessed and suffering terribly”. And here she goes again “Lord, help me” she said. Jesus replied” it is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.” “yes, it is, Lord,” she said. “Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.” Then Jesus said to her, “Women, you have great faith! Your request is granted.” And her daughter was healed at that moment.

### Reflection
Earnest prayer is prayer that is persistent. The Greek word “proseuche”translated as earnestly in James 5 literally means “he prayed with prayer,” which is an idiom expressing persistence in prayer. Hence, the translators said of Elijah that he “prayed earnestly.”
“My house shall be called a house of prayer for all people” (Is 56: 7). Today’s readings testify to the Lord’s longing to enfold all people within his house. Though so many Christian are privileged to belong to the Lord’s house, many others have yet to be brought into it. The church holds that, “the task of evangelizing all people constitutes the essential mission of the church and multitudes have the right to know the riches of the mystery of Christ. “yet, how will they hear of the Lord unless we tell them? How will they see and accept Jesus unless we show them by our life- witness as Christians? proclamation of the word and our life- witness must start first in our homes and then in society at large. Let’s ask for this grace.


YOURS IN CHRIST,
