### Gospel
> 38 In the course of his teaching he said, "Beware of the scribes, who like to go around in long robes and accept greetings in the marketplaces,

> 39 seats of honor in synagogues, and places of honor at banquets.

> 40 They devour the houses of widows and, as a pretext, recite lengthy prayers. They will receive a very severe condemnation."

> 41 He sat down opposite the treasury and observed how the crowd put money into the treasury. Many rich people put in large sums.

> 42 A poor widow also came and put in two small coins worth a few cents.

> 43 Calling his disciples to himself, he said to them, "Amen, I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all the other contributors to the treasury.

> 44 For they have all contributed from their surplus wealth, but she, from her poverty, has contributed all she had, her whole livelihood."

### Reflection
This Gospel begins with Jesus warning the people about the scribes.  He tells the crowd to “Beware of the scribes who dress in long robes, who love the greetings they receive in the marketplaces and the seats of honor they have at banquets and in the synagogue.”  Jesus then accuses the scribes of “devouring” the homes of widows as they recite lengthy prayers.  Jesus is blunt when he says that the scribes will receive a severe condemnation.  Clearly, Jesus was neither a friend nor an admirer of the scribes.

Jesus then sat down opposite the treasury.  He took notice of the individuals who were putting money into the treasury.  Many wealthy individuals put in large sums of money.  However, a poor widow came and put in two small coins that amounted to just a few cents.  Jesus took notice of this woman and her small gift.

Jesus then called his disciples and said to them: “Amen, I say to you, this poor widow put more into the treasury than all the other contributors that were giving to the treasury.  Most people gave from their wealth while this widow gave from her poverty.”  The woman contributed to the treasury much of her small income.  What a generous and loving gift!

Clearly Jesus was rebuking the wealthy who often took from the poor for their own gain.  Jesus then lifts up and praises the poor widow who freely gave to God from the little that she had.  Today may we ask ourselves: Do I give from my abundance or from my want?  How do I share my time, my talents and my treasure?  Or do I have a tendency to hoard my time, talents, and treasure?

Jesus has blessed all of us with many gifts.  However, most of our gifts are not monetary.  How do we share our gifts of joy, love, time and talents?  Do we share these gifts freely?  Or do we hoard them?  Today may we share our abundance throughout our day.  The gifts we give may be simple and yet they may be extremely valuable to the person who receives your gift.  Trust that God, the giver of all good gifts, will use you and your gifts today.  Give thanks for the gifts you have to share with others.  And give thanks for the gifts that others share with you!
