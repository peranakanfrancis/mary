### :love_letter: Gospel
> When Jesus saw a crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side. A scribe approached and said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.” Jesus answered him, “Foxes have dens and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to rest his head.” Another of his disciples said to him, “Lord, let me go first and bury my father.” But Jesus answered him, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead.”

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
This scribe said the right thing to Jesus.  This is the attitude we should all have toward our Lord.  We must be ready and willing to follow Him no matter what.  However, Jesus’ response to this scribe is interesting.  He said, “Foxes have dens and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to rest his head” (Matthew 8:20).

What do we take from this response?  It appears to be a way for Jesus to say to the scribe, “Are you truly ready and willing to follow me no matter what?”  In other words, Jesus wants to illustrate to the scribe that the choice to follow Him is a commitment to travel down a road that is risky only in the sense that following Jesus requires complete trust in Him.  We will not be told, ahead of time, where our Lord will lead and what He will ask of us.  Rather, when we unreservedly choose to follow Jesus, we are putting our trust in Him as a person and are telling Him that we embrace His will no matter what it is.  This level of trust is the key to what Jesus wants.

### :latin_cross: Meditation
Reflect, today, upon two things.  First, reflect upon these words of the scribe and ask yourself whether or not you can confidently say them in your own life.  Say them over and over and try to let them move from your head to your heart as a willing embrace of the Lord’s plan for your life.

Second, reflect upon the effects of such a response in your own life.  Are you willing to not only say these words but to also embrace all that follows from such a commitment?  Are you willing to trust the Lord with your whole life?  Strive to make this firm resolution and this resolution will lead you down the path of much joy.

### :pray: Prayer
My trustworthy Lord, I do commit myself to following You wherever You go.  I choose Your most holy will above all things.  Help me to live faithfully in accord with Your divine will and to say “Yes” to You every day.  Jesus, I trust in You.
