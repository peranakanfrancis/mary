### :speech_balloon: Reflection
What an interesting passage this is.  We start with the obvious premise that Jesus is perfect in every way.  He is the very Wisdom of God and is God.  Everything He said and did reveals the perfect love of the Most Holy Trinity.

But what was the response to Him?  Some people, of course, listened to Him attentively with faith and glorious astonishment at His words and actions.  They could see His divinity shine through and knew He was the Son of God, the Savior of the World.

But this passage reveals that others, even some who were His own relatives, thought He was “Out of His mind!”  Very interesting and very revealing for our own faith journey.

If this was said of Jesus in His perfection, so it also will be said of us if we follow in His ways.  Following Jesus and fulfilling His divine will in our lives will not always be accepted by others.  Yes, acts of kindness and mercy toward the less fortunate, for example, will generally be seen by all as a good and virtuous thing to do.  But there are many things we are called to say and do by the Gospel that will invite the criticism of others.

When this happens, we should not be astonished, hurt or scandalized.  We should not become angry or resentful.  Rather, we should see ourselves as following in the very footsteps of Christ.  We should recall His own false judgments and not allow what we experience from others to deter us from following the will of God.

### :latin_cross: Meditation
Reflect, today, upon any way that you may experience the same thing that Jesus did.  Reflect upon ways that your fidelity to our Lord and His mission may leave others with a critical word or thought toward you.  Do not be shocked or scandalized when this happens.  Instead, know that it is nothing other than an imitation of the life of Christ Jesus Himself.

### :pray: Prayer
My Lord of all wisdom, I know that You were misunderstood and even criticized by others.  You were misrepresented and judged even by those close to You.  Help me to always accept unjust persecution and judgment in life as I seek to follow Your holy and divine will.  Help me to seek You and Your will in all things despite any erroneous opinions of others.  Jesus, I trust in You.
