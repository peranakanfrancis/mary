### Gospel
> 9 I tell you, make friends for yourselves with dishonest wealth, so that when it fails, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.

> 10 The person who is trustworthy in very small matters is also trustworthy in great ones; and the person who is dishonest in very small matters is also dishonest in great ones.

> 11 If, therefore, you are not trustworthy with dishonest wealth, who will trust you with true wealth?

> 12 If you are not trustworthy with what belongs to another, who will give you what is yours?

> 13 No servant can serve two masters. He will either hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon."

> 14 The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all these things and sneered at him.

> 15 And he said to them, "You justify yourselves in the sight of others, but God knows your hearts; for what is of human esteem is an abomination in the sight of God.

### Reflection:
In today’s Gospel Jesus continues his instruction to his disciples. He tells his disciples that if a person can be trusted in small matters, they likely can be trusted with more important matters. Trust is essential to any relationship. If we don’t trust someone, most likely we will keep our distance. Nor will we share anything of importance with them.

Ask yourself: whom do you trust? Whom do you count on to support and love you—no matter what? As you answer that question, I hope God is the One you think of first! God is the one who loves us no matter what we have done or how we have acted. God may invite us to make some changes, but God never stops loving us. God is always there for us! Do we truly believe this? If not, may we pray for the grace to trust our loving God!
