Whether you are a mother, a school teacher, an executive, a mechanic, or a brain surgeon, you are probably busy! You not only have the requirements of your job to fulfil, you may also have caretaking responsibilities for family or extended family.

No matter how busy you are, there is always time for prayer.
Just take one minute to be still, and pray. “Lord Jesus! The one you love is very sick.” (John 11:3).

It is okay to talk to the Lord Jesus Christ in a very simple way.
By praying throughout the day in this simple meaningful way, we invite the Lord Jesus Christ into every area of our lives, and that is exactly what He desires.

### Prayer of Thanks
Lord Jesus Christ
I thank you today
That prayer does not have to be long and complicated.
You hear even my short, heartfelt prayers.
I am grateful that I can have a continuous conversation with you 
All through the day, and that you hear and answer me.
