### Gospel
> 13 No one has gone up to heaven except the one who has come down from heaven, the Son of Man.

> 14 And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,

> 15 so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life."

> 16 For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but might have eternal life.

> 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him.

> 18 Whoever believes in him will not be condemned, but whoever does not believe has already been condemned, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.


### Reflection
The Gospel for this Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross begins as Jesus is talking with Nicodemus. Jesus tells Nicodemus: “No one has gone up to heaven except the one who has come down from heaven, the Son of Man, and just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up! Then everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.”

Did Nicodemus understand what Jesus was saying? Or was he wondering what on earth Jesus was talking about? However, Jesus continued: “For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but have eternal life. God sent his Son into the world so that the world might be saved through him.” What a wondrous gift God and Jesus have given us and continue to give us! The love God and Jesus have for us is beyond our comprehension. On this feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, I invite you to meditate on God’s love for you. Then also reflect on Jesus’ gift to humankind. He literally gave his life for us. However, do we truly appreciate his gift? Or do we simply take it for granted?
