### Gospel
> Do not think that I have come to bring peace upon the earth. I have come to bring not peace but the sword. For I have come to set a man 'against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and one's enemies will be those of his household.' Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever does not take up his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me. Whoever receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and whoever receives a righteous man because he is righteous will receive a righteous man's reward. And whoever gives only a cup of cold water to one of these little ones to drink because he is a disciple--amen, I say to you, he will surely not lose his reward. When Jesus finished giving these commands to his twelve disciples, he went away from that place to teach and to preach in their towns.

### Reflection
Today’s Gospel may be a difficult reading to listen to for many of us. Jesus tells his disciples: “I have not come to bring peace upon earth. I come not to bring peace but the sword! He continues, saying: “I will set son against father, daughter against mother and daughter-in-law.” He also warns them: “Your enemies will be those of your household.”

Jesus then says: “Whoever loves their father or mother, son or daughter, more than me is not worthy of me.” And whoever does not “take up their cross and follow me, is not worthy of me.” He uses several more examples, ultimately telling his disciples (and us) that we are to love Jesus first and foremost! True, we will love our family and friends but Jesus, God and the Spirit are to reign in our lives!

Ask yourself: who or what reigns in your life? Today I invite you to quietly reflect on this question for 10-15 minutes. Do a basic assessment of your life. Ask God to help you see clearly the reality of your life.

What do you wish to change in your life? What is “right” in your life? What is important in your life? Who and what are you thankful for? Thank God for the many gifts and graces you have been given! Ask God to walk with you in your struggles!

God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit are with us, gifting and gracing us! What more could we ask for?
