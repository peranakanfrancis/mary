### :love_letter: Gospel
1. He entered Jericho and was going through the town
2. and suddenly a man whose name was Zacchaeus made his appearance; he was one of the senior tax collectors and a wealthy man.
3. He kept trying to see which Jesus was, but he was too short and could not see him for the crowd;
4. so he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to catch a glimpse of Jesus who was to pass that way.
5. When Jesus reached the spot he looked up and spoke to him, 'Zacchaeus, come down. Hurry, because I am to stay at your house today.'
6. And he hurried down and welcomed him joyfully.
7. They all complained when they saw what was happening. 'He has gone to stay at a sinner's house,' they said.
8. But Zacchaeus stood his ground and said to the Lord, 'Look, sir, I am going to give half my property to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody I will pay him back four times the amount.'
9. And Jesus said to him, 'Today salvation has come to this house, because this man too is a son of Abraham;
10. for the Son of man has come to seek out and save what was lost.'

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
A tax collector named Zacchaeus wants desperately to see Jesus. He is very short and does not have much a chance among the huge crowds of people. So Zacchaeus runs on ahead and climbs a tree so he can get a better view.

Jesus surprisingly stops beneath Zacchaeus and invites Himself to the house of Zacchaeus for dinner.

“When Jesus came by, He looked up at Zacchaeus and called him by name “Zacchaeus!” He said, “Quick, come down! I must be a guest in your home today.” Zacchaeus quickly climbed down and took Jesus to his house in great excitement and joy. (Luke 19:5-6).

Jesus, in noticing Zacchaeus on the tree and inviting himself to the house of Zacchaeus for dinner, touched Zacchaeus and caused Zacchaeus to do something surprising.

Meanwhile, Zacchaeus stood before the Lord and said. “I will give half my wealth to the poor, Lord, and if I have cheated people on their taxes, I will give them back four times as much.” (Luke 19:8).

This is what repentance is. A change of heart and behaviour.

Repentance calls us to act in ways we would not have acted before.
