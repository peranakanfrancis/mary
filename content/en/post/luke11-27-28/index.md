### Gospel
> 27 While he was speaking, a woman from the crowd called out and said to him, "Blessed is the womb that carried you and the breasts at which you nursed."

> 28 He replied, "Rather, blessed are those who hear the word of God and observe it."

### Reflection:
Today’s Gospel is the completion of yesterday’s Gospel reading.  Luke writes: “While Jesus was speaking, a woman from the crowd called out: “Blest is the womb that bore you and the breasts that nursed you”!  Jesus looked directly at the woman and said:”Rather, blest are they who hear the word of God and keep it”!

Today is a good day for each of us to ask ourselves: Do I truly strive to “hear the word of God and keep it”?  Or do I simply sail through the day without even thinking about God or connecting with God, Jesus or the Spirit?  Sad to say, I have to confess when I may not even “think” about God.  Yet, every day we have to opportunity to realize how God, Jesus or the Spirit is present to us!  Today be alert to the “small” happenings and gifts that you receive!  They are a gift that comes from the Ones who love us more than anyone!
