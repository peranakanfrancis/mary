### Gospel
> In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene, during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the desert. He went throughout [the] whole region of the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins, as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah: “A voice of one crying out in the desert: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths. Every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be made low. The winding roads shall be made straight, and the rough ways made smooth, and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.’”

On this, the Second Sunday of Advent, we are given the person of St. John the Baptist to ponder.  What a gift he is!  Jesus Himself stated that “among those born of women there has been none greater than John the Baptist” (Matthew 11:11).  What a compliment!

What is it that made John so great?  We can point to two things in particular.  The first has to do with his calling and the second has to do with his virtue.

First of all, John was great because he was the transition from the Old Testament Prophets to the New Testament.  He was the bridge that prepared for the new life to come.  His unique mission makes him truly great.

But John was great not only because of his unique calling, he was also great because of the virtue he had in his life.  And it is this gift that is worth pondering for our own inspiration more than any other.

The particular virtue that John had was that of humility.  He saw himself as nothing other than a “voice of one crying out in the desert.”  And the Word he spoke was Jesus.  

John acknowledged that he was not even worthy to stoop down and untie the sandal straps of Jesus (Mark 1:7).  He was praised by many and followed by many and yet he continuously said of Jesus that “He must increase and I must decrease” (John 3:30).  John was not in it for praise and honor; rather, his mission was to point everyone to the Savior of the World.  He could have sought the honor and praise of many and he would have certainly received it.  They may have even made him king.  But John was more than willing to fulfill his mission and then submit himself to the cruel sword of his executioner.  His humility was such that he was focused only on Jesus and desired only to point to Him.

### Meditation
Reflect, today, upon this humility in your own life.  Do you tend to point to yourself or to Christ?  Do you seek the praise of others or do you humbly point all praise and glory to God?  Humility is the path that St. John the Baptist took and it’s the path we must strive for each and every day.

### Prayer
Lord, thank You for the gift of St. John the Baptist.  May his witness of humility inspire me in my Christian walk.  Help me, Lord, to always point others to You rather than to myself.  Jesus, I trust in You.
