### :love_letter: Gospel
> He said, “The Son of Man must suffer greatly and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed and on the third day be raised.” Then he said to all, “If anyone wishes to come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it. What profit is there for one to gain the whole world yet lose or forfeit himself?

### :speech_balloon: Reflection:
Many people dream of winning the lottery.  And oftentimes, the dream is for many millions of dollars.  Imagine what you would do if you became an instant millionaire or an instant billionaire.  Do you find yourself daydreaming about this?

If so, perhaps the question above is a good one to ponder.  What good is it if you win the biggest lottery in history, become the wealthiest person on the face of the Earth, but lack the grace of God in your life and lack faith?

Would you trade your faith for being exceptionally wealthy and gaining the whole world?  Many people probably would or else Jesus would not have asked this question.

Very often in life we have the wrong priorities.  We seek instant satisfaction and gratification over eternal fulfillment.  It’s hard for many people to live with an eternal perspective.  

Some may say, “Well, I choose both!  I want the whole world and the salvation of my soul!”  But Jesus’ question presupposes that we cannot have both.  We must pick which one we choose to pursue.  Choosing a life of faith and the salvation of our souls requires that we let go of many things in this world.  Even if God were to bless us with much in this world, we must strive to live in such a way that we are ready and willing to “give it up” if it were beneficial to our eternal salvation, or the salvation of others.

This is hard to do and requires a very deep love of God.  It requires that we are convinced, on the deepest level, that the pursuit of holiness is more important than anything else.

### :latin_cross: Meditation
Reflect, today, upon this profound question from Jesus.  Know that He poses it to you.  How do you respond?  Do not hesitate to make God and His abundant mercy the central focus of your life.  Lent is one of the best times of the year to seriously look at the most fundamental desire and goal of your heart.  Choose Him above all else and you will be eternally grateful you did.

### :pray: Prayer
My eternal Lord, as we enter into this Lenten season, give me the grace I need to look at my priorities.  Help me to honestly discern that which is the most fundamental and central driving motivation of my life.  Help me to choose You above all else so that You will help everything in my life to become ordered in accord with Your holy will.  Jesus, I trust in You.
