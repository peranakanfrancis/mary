### Gospel
In due course John the Baptist appeared; he proclaimed this message in the desert of Judaea, 'Repent, for the kingdom of Heaven is close at hand.' This was the man spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said: A voice of one that cries in the desert, 'Prepare a way for the Lord, make his paths straight.'  This man John wore a garment made of camel-hair with a leather loin-cloth round his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. Then Jerusalem and all Judaea and the whole Jordan district made their way to him, and as they were baptised by him in the river Jordan they confessed their sins. But when he saw a number of Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism he said to them, 'Brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming retribution? Produce fruit in keeping with repentance, and do not presume to tell yourselves, "We have Abraham as our father," because, I tell you, God can raise children for Abraham from these stones. Even now the axe is being laid to the root of the trees, so that any tree failing to produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown on the fire. I baptise you in water for repentance, but the one who comes after me is more powerful than I, and I am not fit to carry his sandals; he will baptise you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing-fan is in his hand; he will clear his threshing-floor and gather his wheat into his barn; but the chaff he will burn in a fire that will never go out.'

### Reflection
“The Spirit of Wisdom and Understanding, The Spirit of Counsel and Might, The Spirit of Knowledge and the Fear of the Lord.” (Isaiah 11:2).

Today John the Baptist introduces to us Jesus, “He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with Fire.” (Matthew 3:11).

Baptized with the Holy Spirit you will be equipped with Gifts/Abilities (Isaiah 11:2). To enjoy “A rich and satisfying Life.” (John 10:10).

THE GIFTS / ABILITIES ARE:
1. **WISDOM**: The ability to use your knowledge and experience to make good decision and judgement.
2. **UNDERSTANDING/INSIGHT**: The ability to have a clear and deep understanding of a complicated problem or situation.
3. **COUNSEL**: The ability to counsel yourself into making a right judgement and decision.
4. **MIGHT**: To be brave and courageous.
5. **KNOWLEDGE**: Understanding of information obtained by experience or study.
6. **FEAR OF THE LORD**: Confidences in God, whose providence surrounds and provides for our needs. Confidence in God, banish all fear from the Heart. “Even when I walk through the Darkest Valley, I will not be afraid, for You are close beside me. Your Rod and Your Staff protect and comfort me.” (Psalm 23:4).

“This is why I remind you to Fan into Flames the Spiritual Gift God gave you when I laid my hands on you. For God has not given us a Spirit of Fear and Timidity, but of Power, Love and Self Discipline.” (2 Timothy 1:6-7).
