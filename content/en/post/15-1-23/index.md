### :love_letter: Gospel
> The next day, he saw Jesus coming towards him and said, 'Look, there is the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world. It was of him that I said, "Behind me comes one who has passed ahead of me because he existed before me." I did not know him myself, and yet my purpose in coming to baptise with water was so that he might be revealed to Israel.' And John declared, 'I saw the Spirit come down on him like a dove from heaven and rest on him. I did not know him myself, but he who sent me to baptise with water had said to me, "The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and rest is the one who is to baptise with the Holy Spirit." I have seen and I testify that he is the Chosen One of God.'

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
“Look! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!” (John 1:29).
Jesus is “The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.” (John 1:29).

John the Baptist uses the singular form of the word sin rather than the plural. He is talking about the root of sin as a whole, not just the individual sins committed one at a time.
The root of sin is destructive negative thinking patterns. If we have a negative mind, we will have a negative life. “As a face is reflected in water, so the heart (mind) reflects the real person.” (Proverbs 27:19).

If we change our mind, we will change our lives. “Let God transform you into a new person by changing the you think.” (Romans 12:2).

In loving us, our Lord Jesus Christ, teaches us, “to live in truth and love.” (2 John 1:3). Changes the way we think, “takes away the sin of the world.” (John 1:29). To enable us to enjoy “a rich and satisfying life.” (John 10:10).

“The one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.” (John 1:33).

To baptize is to dip or to submerge. Jesus will baptize me with the Holy Spirit, means the Jesus can bring the Spirit of God to us in such a way that we are saturated, and our Life and Being are flooded with that Spirit. To teach and empower us to enjoy “a rich and satisfying life.” (John 10:10).

O God and Father,
make me open to your “Good News” about your beloved Son, Our Lord Jesus Christ, as I begin to pray the Gospel of St. Matthew in the New Year, 2023.

Create in me, a thirst for His saving life giving word, to change the way I think to enjoy “A rich and satisfying life” (John 10:10) in 2023.

In the New Year 2023, empower me to “be doers of the world, and not hearers only.” (James 1:22).

Your word is a Lamp to guide my feet and a light for my path.” (Psalm 119:105).
