Always be joyful.
Never stop praying. 
Be thankful in all circumstances,
For this is Godâ€™s will for you who belong to Christ Jesus.
(1 Thessalonians 5:16)

Come Holy Spirit
I need you
To remind and empower me
Always be joyful
Never stop praying.
Be thankful in all circumstances.
To live a rich and satisfying life.
Amen.
