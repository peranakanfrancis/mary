### :love_letter: Gospel
> When the days were completed for their purification according to the law of Moses, they took him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord, just as it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every male that opens the womb shall be consecrated to the Lord,” and to offer the sacrifice of “a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons,” in accordance with the dictate in the law of the Lord. Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout, awaiting the consolation of Israel, and the holy Spirit was upon him. It had been revealed to him by the holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Messiah of the Lord. He came in the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to perform the custom of the law in regard to him, he took him into his arms and blessed God, saying: “Now, Master, you may let your servant go in peace, according to your word, for my eyes have seen your salvation, which you prepared in sight of all the peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and glory for your people Israel." The child’s father and mother were amazed at what was said about him; and Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, “Behold, this child is destined for the fall and rise of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be contradicted (and you yourself a sword will pierce)* so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.”

### :speech_balloon: Reflection:
On this, the fifth day of the Octave of Christmas, we are given the witness of the prophet Simeon.  This holy man was promised by God by a personal revelation that he would actually see, with his own eyes, the Savior of the World.  Throughout his life he would have anticipated this moment.  He would have longed for it and hoped for it.  And then, one day the moment came.  Simeon would have woken up that day, going about his normal routine like any other day.  However, the moment that Mary and Joseph brought their newborn Child into the temple, Simeon knew in his heart that this Child was the promised Savior.

His words are powerful.  He says, “Lord, now You can let Your servant go in peace…for my eyes have seen the salvation You have prepared…”  In other words, Simeon realized that his life was now complete.  He was ready to die because he had now been privileged to actually see the Christ.
He held Jesus in his arms and gave glory to the Father for this moment.

We should strive to learn from holy Simeon.  No, we are not a prophet in the Temple some 2,000 years ago, but we are privileged to see the Christ each day in numerous ways.  The Child Simeon held was God indeed.  But He was God under the veil of the flesh of a little Child.  Simeon, nonetheless, saw Him for who He was and rejoiced.

We must strive to perceive the presence of the Savior all around us and rejoice with Simeon’s joy.  Christ is present in every heart that is given to God, every Sacrament of the Church, every reading of the Holy Scripture, and He is especially present to us within our hearts.  Our hearts must be that temple in which we discover the presence of the Christ Child and we must take Him into our lives rejoicing in how close He is.  

### :heavy_check_mark: Meditation
Reflect, today, upon that scene of Simeon taking the Child into his hands and seeing the Savior under the veil of the flesh and bones of this Infant.  Seek out Christ in the same way that Simeon did and ponder the many ways that He is present to You.  Know that He is near and that He wants to fill your life with His peace.

### :pray: Prayer
Lord, I thank You for the great witness of Simeon the Prophet.  Thank You for Your fidelity to Simeon in letting him see You as a little Child.  May I always imitate his great faith and seek You all my life, waiting for You to come to me in veiled ways so that my heart may rejoice in Your presence.  Jesus, I trust in You.
