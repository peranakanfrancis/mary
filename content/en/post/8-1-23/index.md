### :love_letter: Gospel
> After Jesus had been born at Bethlehem in Judaea during the reign of King Herod, suddenly some wise men came to Jerusalem from the east asking, 'Where is the infant king of the Jews? We saw his star as it rose and have come to do him homage.' When King Herod heard this he was perturbed, and so was the whole of Jerusalem. He called together all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, and enquired of them where the Christ was to be born. They told him, 'At Bethlehem in Judaea, for this is what the prophet wrote: And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, you are by no means the least among the leaders of Judah, for from you will come a leader who will shepherd my people Israel.' Then Herod summoned the wise men to see him privately. He asked them the exact date on which the star had appeared and sent them on to Bethlehem with the words, 'Go and find out all about the child, and when you have found him, let me know, so that I too may go and do him homage.' Having listened to what the king had to say, they set out. And suddenly the star they had seen rising went forward and halted over the place where the child was. The sight of the star filled them with delight, and going into the house they saw the child with his mother Mary, and falling to their knees they did him homage. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh. But they were given a warning in a dream not to go back to Herod, and returned to their own country by a different way.

“They entered the house and saw the child with His Mother, Mary, and they bowed down and worshipped Him.” (Matthew 2:11).

The star that had guided the Wisemen from the east “stopped over the place where the Child was” (Matthew 2:9) and the star receded from view. Having found Jesus, the Wisemen do not need the star anymore. From now on Jesus, the Good Shepherd, will lead and guide the Wisemen.

Likewise, with Jesus, the Good Shepherd, with us, to lead and guide us, we do not need to consult mediums, horoscope and palmistry about what is to come. God is the sole master of our future. He will lead and guide us and keep us from despair and fear of what is to come. “See, I have written your name on the palms of my hands.” (Isaiah 49:16).

They entered the house and saw the Child with His Mother, Mary, and they bowed down and worshipped Him.” (Matthew 2:11).

Strikingly, we meet only “Mary, His Mother” by the side of Jesus at the scene of adoration. No mention of St. Joseph.

The Wisemen from the East, were foreign dignitaries coming to pay tribute to “the Newborn King of the Jews.” (Matthew 2:3).

“His Mother, Mary” (Matthew 2:11) by His side, was the Queen Mother, Mother of the King.

The Queen Mother, the Mother of the King, was an important part of the Royal Government of the Davidic Dynasty. One of the Most important advisers to the King. To speak to the King on behalf of the people. “Speak to King Solomon on my behalf. For I know he will do anything you request.” (1 King 2:17).

“So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak on Adonijah’s behalf. The King rose from his throne to meet her, and he bowed down before her. When he sat down on his throne again, the King ordered that a throne be brought for his mother, and she sat at his right hand.

“I have one small request to make of you” she said. “I hope you would not turn me down.”

“What is it, my Mother?” he asked. “You know I would not refuse you.” (1 King 2:19-20).

Likewise, in the Church, the Kingdom of God, Mary, the Mother of Jesus Christ, The King, The Queen Mother speak to the Lord Jesus Christ on our behalf. “They have no more wine.” (John 2:3).

“They bowed down and worshipped Him” (Matthew 2:11) they prostrated face down and arms stretched out to adore God in human flesh and offered Him Gifts of Gold, Frankincense and Myrrh.

This is the type of response we should have even today when we meet Jesus in the Eucharist. Though with the eyes of our bodies we see what appears to be only bread, with the eyes of faith we know it to be the very Body of Our Lord.

We, like the Wisemen, can show Jesus great reverence when we kneel before His real presence in the Eucharist.

We too can bring Him gifts. The Gifts of our hearts in praise and thanksgiving.

Always, begin our Prayer with Praise and Worship. To acknowledge God as Creator and Saviour. The Sole Master of our future, and be thankful for our lives and all that God gives us and does for us.

“Do not worry about anything, instead pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank Him for all he has done.” (Philippians 4:6).
