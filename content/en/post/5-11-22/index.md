> “A CHEERFUL HEART IS GOOD MEDICINE, BUT A BROKEN SPIRIT SAPS A PERSON’S STRENGTH.” - Proverbs 17:22

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
Praise God for laughter, what a wonderful gift! Laughter has tremendous power, and this is something everyone would be wise to do more of. We tend to be so anxious about everything, our sins expecting perfections from ourselves, our personal growth, and trying to meet people’s expectations. We can carry heavy burdens that Jesus never intended us to carry.

If we would just laugh a little more. We would find that a little bit of laughter makes our load much lighter. In the world we live in it is easy to find plenty to worry about, but we can choose to purposely find things to laugh about. Take every opportunity you can find to laugh and laugh and laugh!

### PRAYER OF THANKS
Almighty and merciful God, I thank You that Your Joy is my Strength and that laughter is a Good Medicine. Help me not to carry burdens that You never intended me to carry. Help me to relax and enjoy the Power of Laughter.
