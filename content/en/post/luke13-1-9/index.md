### Gospel
> 1 At that time some people who were present there told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with the blood of their sacrifices.

> 2 He said to them in reply, "Do you think that because these Galileans suffered in this way they were greater sinners than all other Galileans?

> 3 By no means! But I tell you, if you do not repent, you will all perish as they did!

> 4 Or those eighteen people who were killed when the tower at Siloam fell on them --do you think they were more guilty than everyone else who lived in Jerusalem?

> 5 By no means! But I tell you, if you do not repent, you will all perish as they did!"

> 6 And he told them this parable: "There once was a person who had a fig tree planted in his orchard, and when he came in search of fruit on it but found none,

> 7 he said to the gardener, 'For three years now I have come in search of fruit on this fig tree but have found none. (So) cut it down. Why should it exhaust the soil?'

> 8 He said to him in reply, 'Sir, leave it for this year also, and I shall cultivate the ground around it and fertilize it;

> 9 it may bear fruit in the future. If not you can cut it down.'"

### Reflection:
In today’s Gospel, several people come to Jesus and tell him about  the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with the blood of their sacrifices.  Jesus asks his listeners: “Do you think these Galileans suffered because they were greater sinners than all other Galileans?  By no means is this so!”  Jesus then tells his listeners: “If you do not repent, you also will perish just as they did.”  Jesus then gives them the example of the people who were killed when the tower of Siloam fell on them.  He asks his listeners: “Do you believe that they were more guilty than all the other people in Jerusalem?”

Jesus then tells his listeners the parable of the fig tree that a man planted in his orchard.  When the man came to pick the fruit, there was none to be found.  The tree had not born any fruit. The owner said to the gardener, “For three years I have waited patiently for this tree to bear fruit.  However, it has not produced any fruit at all.”  The owner then instructed the gardener to cut down the tree.  However, the gardener politely protested.  He said to the owner: “Sir, leave it for one more growing season.  I will work the ground and fertilize the tree.  Then if it does not bear fruit, I will cut it down.”

Today may be a good opportunity to ask ourselves: How am I bearing fruit?    Am I producing tasty fruit?  Or is my fruit small and somewhat tasteless?  Am I producing an abundant crop or a meager crop?  And what are the fruits that I  share with the people in my life and with the world?

We may consider our fruits small or insignificant.  However, often a simple act of kindness may be a loving gift to the individual who receives your kindness.  Today, trust that you will bear fruit.  And be thankful for the “fruits” other people share with you!
