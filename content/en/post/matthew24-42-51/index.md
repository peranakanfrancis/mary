### Gospel
> 42 Therefore, stay awake! For you do not know on which day your Lord will come.

> 43 Be sure of this: if the master of the house had known the hour of night when the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and not let his house be broken into.

> 44 So too, you also must be prepared, for at an hour you do not expect, the Son of Man will come.

> 45 "Who, then, is the faithful and prudent servant, whom the master has put in charge of his household to distribute to them their food at the proper time?

> 46 Blessed is that servant whom his master on his arrival finds doing so.

> 47 Amen, I say to you, he will put him in charge of all his property.

> 48 But if that wicked servant says to himself, 'My master is long delayed,'

> 49 and begins to beat his fellow servants, and eat and drink with drunkards,

> 50 the servant's master will come on an unexpected day and at an unknown hour

> 51 and will punish him severely and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.

### Reflection
Stay awake! These are Jesus’ words to us today. He tells us that we do not know the day nor the time when the Lord will come to us. Thus, each and every moment we must be awake and watchful. This may sound impossible to do. However, I think of parents who have young children. I assume their radar is always tuned into where their children are and what they are doing. It becomes second nature. I assume that all of us also have our radar tuned into the individuals in our lives who are special to us.

Today Jesus desires that we also have our radar scanning for his coming or his presence. The reality is we do not know when or how or through whom Jesus may come to us or be present to us. However, staying awake and alert is not as easy as it sounds. Perhaps though, we can enhance our radar system to be more closely attuned to Jesus’ vibes, to his presence with us. If we truly desire to be attentive to Jesus’ presence throughout our day, we can train ourselves to do so just as first- time parents attune themselves to their new baby’s presence and needs. Today attune the ear of your heart to Jesus’ presence with you!
