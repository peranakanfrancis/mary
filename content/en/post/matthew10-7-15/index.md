### Gospel
> As you go, make this proclamation: 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.' Cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, drive out demons. Without cost you have received; without cost you are to give. Do not take gold or silver or copper for your belts; no sack for the journey, or a second tunic, or sandals, or walking stick. The laborer deserves his keep.  Whatever town or village you enter, look for a worthy person in it, and stay there until you leave. As you enter a house, wish it peace. If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; if not, let your peace return to you. Whoever will not receive you or listen to your words--go outside that house or town and shake the dust from your feet. Amen, I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.

### Reflection
In today’s Gospel, Jesus continues his instruction to his disciples. He tells them that they should proclaim his message: “The Kingdom of heaven is at hand.” He also empowers them to cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers and drive out demons.

Jesus then instructs his disciples to travel lightly. They are not to take any money or any extra clothing, sandals, etc., with them. They are to trust in the generosity of the people they will be serving. They are to trust and believe that what they need, will be provided for them. Were his disciples amazed, surprised or nervous when they heard Jesus’ instructions? After all, shouldn’t they take something along on their journey (just in case)?

If we are disciples of Jesus, he also is empowering us with the ability “to cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers and drive out demons.” Now take a moment and ask yourself: how am I able to heal/cure, to give life and hope and meaning to individuals who are struggling? For yourself, name two or three ways you will strive to “share life” with others today.

Jesus desires that we share the gifts and graces we receive with other individuals who are in need. Most likely the gifts and graces we have to share may seem insignificant to us: a helping hand, visiting with someone who is lonely, or perhaps smiling at someone you pass in the grocery store. Who knows: today you may be presented with the perfect opportunity to share your abundance. Be alert! Be generous with your smile, laughter and attention!
