### Gospel
> 1 Meanwhile, so many people were crowding together that they were trampling one another underfoot. He began to speak, first to his disciples, "Beware of the leaven--that is, the hypocrisy--of the Pharisees.

> 2 "There is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, nor secret that will not be known.

> 3 Therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered behind closed doors will be proclaimed on the housetops.

> 4 I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body but after that can do no more.

> 5 I shall show you whom to fear. Be afraid of the one who after killing has the power to cast into Gehenna; yes, I tell you, be afraid of that one.

> 6 Are not five sparrows sold for two small coins? Yet not one of them has escaped the notice of God.

> 7 Even the hairs of your head have all been counted. Do not be afraid. You are worth more than many sparrows.

### Reflection:
Today Jesus warns his disciples: “beware of the yeast of the Pharisees.”  The Pharisees were extremely religious and they lived out the letter of the law.  However, the “spirit of the law” and the “law of love” was not always part of their “lived” belief system.  Jesus understood this when he realized that they were plotting to destroy him.  Thus he became even more wary of the Pharisees.

Jesus then warns his disciples about fear.  He tells them not to fear the individuals who may have the power to “kill” them (and us).  Rather we should be mindful of the people in our lives who strive to kill our souls and separate us from Him.  Today may be a good day to ask ourselves: who are the “Pharisees” in my life?  Who and what separates me from Jesus?  Is it another person or an addiction?  Or is it my need to always look good in other people’s eyes?  We also need to examine ourselves: How am I a “Pharisee” to the people in my life?

As we know, the Pharisees were legalists. To these important men, the letter of the law always took precedence over anything else.  Today ask yourself: what “law” takes precedence in your life?  Is it the law of love?  Or is it the letter of the law?  Jesus does not want us to ignore the law.  However, law has a hierarchy.  As we know, the consequences for getting a speeding ticket is not nearly as serious an offense as stealing money, injuring someone or discrediting another person.

Today Jesus is inviting us to examine ourselves.  Today may we ask ourselves: How am I a Pharisee?  Do my words and actions flow from love and care for others?  Or do I simply want to look good in the eyes of others?  The reality is: we all have a Pharisee within us.  However, we also have a generous and loving person within us.  Be mindful today!  Which person will you choose to be today?  Only you can decide!
