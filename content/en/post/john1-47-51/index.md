### Gospel
> 47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him, "Here is a true Israelite. There is no duplicity in him."

> 48 Nathanael said to him, "How do you know me?" Jesus answered and said to him, "Before Philip called you, I saw you under the fig tree."

> 49 Nathanael answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel."

> 50 Jesus answered and said to him, "Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than this."

> 51 And he said to him, "Amen, amen, I say to you, you will see the sky opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."

### Reflection
This is the feast day of the Archangels: Michael, Gabriel and Raphael. Now ask yourself: Is this feast meaningful to me? Do I believe in angels regardless of whether they are archangels or just regular angels?

Most of us learned about angels at a young age. There are angels in the Scriptures. In the past years, there have been books and TV shows focused on angels. Yet I suspect that many of us have not had a personal and upclose experience of an angel, a heavenly being, appearing to us.

Yet I also believe that if we take time to think about it, we hopefully could name several people in our lives who are angels to us. It may be someone who notices us and asks how we are. Or perhaps it is someone who anticipates our needs. Or it may be a person who surprises us with a simple gift or their time or attention.

Today take note of the angels that appear to you! And strive to be an angel to the individuals you encounter! It can be a simple gift to give.
