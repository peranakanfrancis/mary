“And another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer. And He was given much incense to mingle with the prayer of all the Saints upon the golden altar before the throne, and the smoke of the incense rose with the prayers of the saints from the hand of the angel before God.” (Revelation 8:3-4). Their powerful prayer, mediated by angels, rises in heaven, has immediate effects upon earth. “Then the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth, and there were peals of thunder, voices, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.” (Revelation 8:5).

### Prayer of Thanks
O God, I thank you
For your Saints
“Standing in front of the throne
And before the lamb” (Revelation 7:9)
Interceding for me
To receive your mercy
To find grace to help me
When I need it most.
