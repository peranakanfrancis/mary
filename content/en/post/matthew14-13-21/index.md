### Gospel
> 13 When Jesus heard of it, he withdrew in a boat to a deserted place by himself. The crowds heard of this and followed him on foot from their towns.

> 14 When he disembarked and saw the vast crowd, his heart was moved with pity for them, and he cured their sick.

> 15 When it was evening, the disciples approached him and said, "This is a deserted place and it is already late; dismiss the crowds so that they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."

> 16 (Jesus) said to them, "There is no need for them to go away; give them some food yourselves."

> 17 But they said to him, "Five loaves and two fish are all we have here."

> 18 Then he said, "Bring them here to me,"

> 19 and he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he said the blessing, broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples, who in turn gave them to the crowds.

> 20 They all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up the fragments left over twelve wicker baskets full.

> 21 Those who ate were about five thousand men, not counting women and children.

### Reflection
Today in the Gospel, Jesus received devastating news. He heard that his beloved cousin, John, had been brutally beheaded. In the wake of this news, Jesus needed time to be alone to absorb this news and begin to grieve for his dear friend.

Jesus got into a boat and withdrew to a deserted place. However, his time for grieving was short-lived. The crowd of people followed him and arrived there before him. I wonder if Jesus was tempted to start rowing to find another place where he could be alone? However, Matthew writes “that Jesus’ heart was moved with pity for the crowd.” Jesus got out of the boat and ministered to the people. He healed all those who yearned to be “whole” again.

As evening drew near, the disciples realized that many had not brought any food to eat. They were concerned for the people but they did not know what to do. They went to Jesus and told him to send the people away to the towns where they could buy food. However, Jesus instructs his disciples to feed the crowd. His disciples immediately protested. They said: “We only have two fish and five loaves of bread! This small amount of food will never be enough for this huge crowd!”

Jesus, however, was not disturbed or worried. He told his disciples to bring the fish and the bread to him. Then he instructed the crowd of people to sit down on the grass. I wonder what the disciples were thinking as they gathered the food? Did they think Jesus was crazy? Or were they anticipating another miracle?

Jesus took the bread and the fish and he blessed them. He then gave the bread and fish to his disciples and instructed them to distribute the food to the people. They did so. And as we know, everyone was well fed and there were quite a few baskets of leftovers.

Do you ever get concerned that you may not have “enough” for what seems to be needed? It may not be enough money, energy, time, love, appreciation or __________ (you fill in the blank). These are the times when we need to come to Jesus and ask him to supply us with what we truly need. And Jesus will give us what we need. However, it may not be exactly what we asked for. At these times, will we trust that Jesus is supplying us with “the loaves and fishes” that we need? Or will we complain because Jesus had disappointed us?

Today, may we trust Jesus to gift us with everything we need. And may we remember to thank him!
