“As the blast of the Ram’s horn grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God thundered his reply.” (Exodus 19:19).

It is important that we do not think that prayer and fellowship with God is us doing all the talking. We can also spend time with Him listening, “Speak, your servant is listening.” (1Samuel 3:10).

Prayer is a two-way street, not only does God hear us, but thankfully, he speaks to us too.

“As the blast of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God thundered His reply”. (Exodus 19:19).

A great exercise to practice listening to God is to ask Him, if there is anyone, he wants you to encourage. Then be still and listen. You will be surprised at how quickly he responds. You will have some people come to mind and some creative ideas on how to encourage them.

These “ideas” and “thoughts” are God speaking to you. God speaks in many different ways, but one thing is for sure, we will miss His voice if we do not learn to listen.

God has ideas to present to you that you have not even considered. Listen carefully to Him with a heart that is thankful for His presence.
Then follow the advice given in John 2:5 “Do whatever he tells you”.

### Prayer of  Thanks 
Lord Jesus Christ
I praise and thank you that in prayer,
You not only hear me, but thankfully you speak to me too.
To comfort, teach, encourage and guide me to prosper and succeed in all I do.
To live a rich and satisfying Life.

Holy Spirit, remind and discipline me to pray in the morning and at night with 
Confidence and trust to receive mercy and find help in time of need.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son
and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning
is now and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
