The church would like to greet a Happy Birthday to our former Parish Priest of Fr Augustine Wong. He has been appointed as Parish Priest to Church of The Holy Name of Mary Permatang Tinggi from Jan 2011 until arch 2021. Almost for a decade he has served his entire service to the community, and the church an finally retired last March. At the moment, he is staying in Taman Permatang Tinggi Indah. We pray to the Lord that Fr Wong has a peaceful and joyful day for the rest of his life.
