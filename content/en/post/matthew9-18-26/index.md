### Gospel
> While he was saying these things to them, an official came forward, knelt down before him, and said, “My daughter has just died. But come, lay your hand on her, and she will live.” Jesus rose and followed him, and so did his disciples. A woman suffering hemorrhages for twelve years came up behind him and touched the tassel on his cloak. She said to herself, “If only I can touch his cloak, I shall be cured.” Jesus turned around and saw her, and said, “Courage, daughter! Your faith has saved you.” And from that hour the woman was cured. When Jesus arrived at the official’s house and saw the flute players and the crowd who were making a commotion, he said, “Go away! The girl is not dead but sleeping.” And they ridiculed him. When the crowd was put out, he came and took her by the hand, and the little girl arose. And news of this spread throughout all that land.”

### Reflection
Today we hear the familiar story of the official whose young daughter had died. The father approaches Jesus, kneels at his feet and tells him that his daughter had just died. The father was broken-hearted. The official begged Jesus: “Please, come and place your hand on her! Then she will live!” Jesus immediately got up and followed the official to his home.

As they were walking to the official’s house, a woman who had been afflicted with hemorrhages for twelve long years approached Jesus. Unobtrusively, she reached out and simply touched his cloak. This woman had absolute faith that if she touched Jesus’ cloak, she would be completely healed. Although the woman only touched Jesus’ cloak for a second, he immediately experienced her presence and her healing. He turned to her and said: “Courage, daughter! Your faith has saved you!” And immediately the woman was healed!

Jesus then continues on to the official’s house. When he arrived, there were flute players and a house full of people who were making a commotion. Immediately, Jesus tells them: “Go away! The child is not dead! She is sleeping!” Many people in the crowd ridiculed Jesus. Who did he think he was? Clearly, the child was dead!

Finally, everyone left the house except Jesus and the child’s family. Jesus simply went to the girl, took her hand, and immediately the little girl rose from the bed. Her family must have been amazed, astounded and joyful! Their daughter had been taken from them but Jesus had brought her back to life! What a wondrous gift Jesus gave to this child and her family.

Ask yourself: Is there a part of you that is dead or in the process of dying? What is the life you desire to experience once again? Do you have faith that Jesus will bring you back to life? Do you believe that once again, you also will experience hope and joy?

We recover slowly from “the hemorrhages” that disrupt our lives and our peace. Unlike the little girl, we typically are not brought back to life in an instant. Rather, this may take longer than we like. And while we are waiting and hoping to come back to life, we may feel hopeless and alone. Yet, if we trust in Jesus, he will take our hand and we will arise. More likely, the reality is that Jesus already is holding our hand. We simply are unaware of it.

Today, will we reach out to touch Jesus’ cloak? Or will someone else intercede for us and beg Jesus to bring us back to life? Or we may intercede for another person and ask Jesus to heal the one who is in pain. Truly, Jesus is with us! Jesus is healing us and bringing us back to life! Do we trust Him?

He will not fail us!
