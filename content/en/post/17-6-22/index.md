### :speech_balloon: Reflection
So where is your heart?  The answer to that question is answered above.  Your heart is wherever your treasure is.  So, that begs the question, “What is your treasure?”

This particular passage points to the danger of becoming overly attached to material wealth.  But the same goes for anything in this life we can tend to become attached to.  What is it you are attached to?  What is your treasure?

Ideally, our hearts are attached only to that which God wants them attached.  If that’s the case, then the things we love are the treasures that God wants us to love.  And by loving those things, we are loving the God who gives them and calls us to love them.

Our treasure should certainly include our family and those others who we are called to love and care for with a special affection.  Our treasure should also be our life of prayer and worship.  That’s the most direct way we love God in this world.  Our treasure could also be particular acts of service we are inspired to do, or anything that makes up the will of God.

Do you love these things?  Are they your treasure?  The problem is that way too often we tend to love much more than that which God calls us to love.  We become deeply attached to the idea of getting rich and having many things.  But our unhealthy “loves” can extend even beyond wealth and material things.

### :latin_cross: Meditation
Reflect, today, upon those things that you may have made far too much of a “treasure” in your life.  What is it that you are overly attached to in this passing world?  Is it money?  Or is it something else?  Allow God to show you and then allow Him to free you from it.  That is the first step toward a life of the greatest of riches!

### :pray: Prayer
Lord of true riches, help me to keep my heart fixed on You.  Help me to keep You and Your will as my greatest treasure.  Jesus, I trust in You.
