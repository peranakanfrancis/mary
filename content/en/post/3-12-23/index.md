The Gospel according to St. Mark

1. Author: John Mark.
                 A gentile Christian.
                 A Disciple of St. Peter.
                 His gospel was compiled
   From the preaching of St. Peter.
                 In His Gospel we hear again the voice of St. Peter preaching.

2. Date written AD 55 to 65.

3. Audience: St. Mark wrote His gospel for Christians in Rome, where many Gods were worshipped. He wanted His readers to know that Jesus is the one true son of God.

4. Theme: Jesus, the son of God.
   Mark 1:1 - St. Mark begins His story about Jesus, the Son of God.
   Mark 15:16 - St. Mark ends His story “When the Roman officer who stood facing Him saw how He exclaimed, “This man truly was the son of God!

5. Presentation
  St. Mark wrote His gospel in the form of a fast-paced story, like a popular novel. The book portrays Jesus as a man who backed up His words with action (healing the sick, casting out demons, forgiving sinners, calm a sea storm, and walking on water) that constantly proved who He is, the son of God (Divine).

6. For us who read St. Mark’s gospel today, the message is clear, that we must not ignore or reject Jesus Christ.

### Prayer
Come Holy Spirit,
I need you.
To lead me 
Into a fresh living life
Changing encounter with
The Lord Jesus Christ, The Son of God.
When I listen and read the Gospel of St. Mark.
