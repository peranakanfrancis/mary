1. In Islam, Taoism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Christianity there is the common practice of Morning and Evening Prayer.
This common practice of morning and evening prayer is due to the common human need to pray in the morning and in the evening to begin and end well each day.

2. Jesus often draws apart to pray in solitude on a mountain in the morning and at night.
“Before day break the next morning, Jesus got up and went out to an isolated place to pray.” (Mark 1:35).
“One day soon afterward Jesus went up on a mountain to pray, and he prayed to God all night.” (Luke 6:12).

3. Samples of morning and night prayers (needs to be adapted to personal needs).
- Morning Prayer
Almighty and merciful God, I adore you, I praise you, you are “my Lord and my God.” (John 20:28).
I praise and thank you for a restful night.
I praise and thank you for healing and restoring me in mind and body while I sleep.
I praise and thank you in your great mercy, you raise up in good health, I praise and thank you for the gift of a new and wonderful day. Be with me and in me through-out this day.
Bless me, protect me with the precious blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. To protect me from the wickedness and snares of the devil, physical hurt, infections of diseases and toxic. In what I eat and drink today.
Come Holy Spirit, I need you, to teach, lead and empower me to prosper and succeed in all I do. May I bring joy to all I meet this day.
“Glory to the Father, and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.”

- Night Prayer
Almighty and merciful God

I praise you for your loving care and protection.
I praise and thank you for .......................
Forgive me for ........................................
Grant to me a restful night.
While I sleep, heal and restore me in mind and body.
In your great mercy raise me up
In good health tomorrow morning.
Thanking you for the gift of a new and wonderful day.
Protect me while I sleep that I may rest in peace.
“Father, I entrust my spirit into your hands.” (Luke 23:46).
“Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.
As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be world without end. Amen.”

“And each morning and evening they stood before the Lord to sing songs of thanks and praise to Him.” (1 Chronicles 23:30).
“I rise early, before the sun is up. I cry out for help and put my hope in your words.
I stay awake through the night thinking about your promise. (Psalm 119:147-148).
