### :love_letter: Gospel
> But at daybreak on the first day of the week they took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb. They found the stone rolled away from the tomb; but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. While they were puzzling over this, behold, two men in dazzling garments appeared to them. They were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground. They said to them, “Why do you seek the living one among the dead? He is not here, but he has been raised. Remember what he said to you while he was still in Galilee, that the Son of Man must be handed over to sinners and be crucified, and rise on the third day.”

> And they remembered his words. Then they returned from the tomb and announced all these things to the eleven and to all the others. The women were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James; the others who accompanied them also told this to the apostles, but their story seemed like nonsense and they did not believe them. But Peter got up and ran to the tomb, bent down, and saw the burial cloths alone; then he went home amazed at what had happened.

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
It is on this day that we honor the fact that Jesus was still preaching.  He descended to the land of the dead, to all the holy souls who had gone before Him, so as to bring them His gift of salvation.  He brought His gift of mercy and redemption to Moses, Abraham, the prophets and so many others.  This was a day of great joy for them.  But a day of great sorrow and confusion for those who watched their Messiah die on the Cross.

It’s helpful to ponder this apparent contradiction.  Jesus was accomplishing His act of redemption, the greatest act of love ever known, and so many were in complete confusion and despair.  It shows that God’s ways are so far above our own ways.  What appeared to be a great loss actually turned into the most glorious triumph ever known.  

So it is with our lives.  Holy Saturday should be a reminder to us that even those things which seem to be the worst of tragedies are not always what they seem.  God the Son was obviously doing great things as He laid in the tomb.  He was accomplishing His mission of redemption.  He was changing lives and pouring forth grace and mercy.  

The message of Holy Saturday is clear.  It’s a message of hope.  Not hope in a worldly sense, rather, it’s the message of divine hope.  Hope and trust in God’s perfect plan.  Hope in the fact that God always has a greater purpose.  Hope in the fact that God uses suffering and, in this case, death as a powerful instrument of salvation.

### :latin_cross: Meditation
Spend time in silence today.  Try to enter into the reality of Holy Saturday.  Let divine hope grow within you knowing that Easter is soon to come.  

### :pray: Prayer
Lord of all hope, I thank You for the gift of Your suffering and death.

Thank You for this day of silence as we await Your Resurrection.  May I also await Your triumph in my life.  When I struggle with despair, dear Lord, help me to be reminded of this day.  The day when all appeared as loss.  Help me to see my struggles through the lens of Holy Saturday, remembering that You are faithful in all things and that the Resurrection is always assured to those who put their trust in You.  Jesus, I do trust in You.
