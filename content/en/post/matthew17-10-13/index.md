### Gospel
> Then the disciples asked him, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?” He said in reply,* “Elijah will indeed come and restore all things; but I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands.” Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist.

### Reflection
As we continue to reflect upon St. John the Baptist, we see that his role of being Elijah was missed by the scribes.  They failed to see him fulfilling Elijah’s role of preparing the way for the Lord.  

Though John had a unique and definitive role in preparing for the coming of Christ, so also do each one of us have a role in preparing for His continual coming.  Jesus came once many years ago, but He desires to continue coming into our lives.  And He can only come if we properly prepare for Him.

How do you “prepare the way of the Lord?”  How do you continue the work of John the Baptist?  You do so, especially in Advent, by heeding the main message of John.  And what was his main message?  His message was to repent of our sin.

Though we all struggle with sin as a result of our fallen human nature, we should never forget that our calling is that of perfection.  We are called to be perfect as the Father in Heaven is perfect.  We are called to recognize our sins, confess them, and strive to become detached from them.

Advent is one of the most important times of year to do this and it is especially important that we seek out the grace of the Sacrament of Reconciliation during this holy season.  

### Meditation
Reflect, today, upon how ready and willing you are to preach to your own soul about the importance of repenting of your sins.  Embracing repentance in this holy season is the best way to prepare for the continuous coming of Christ in your life.

### Prayer
Lord, help me to see my sin as we enter more deeply into this Advent season.  Help me to be aware of the many things that keep me from You and to turn from them wholeheartedly.  Jesus, I trust in You.
