### Gospel
> 43 "A good tree does not bear rotten fruit, nor does a rotten tree bear good fruit.

> 44 For every tree is known by its own fruit. For people do not pick figs from thornbushes, nor do they gather grapes from brambles.

> 45 A good person out of the store of goodness in his heart produces good, but an evil person out of a store of evil produces evil; for from the fullness of the heart the mouth speaks.

> 46 "Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' but not do what I command?

> 47 I will show you what someone is like who comes to me, listens to my words, and acts on them.

> 48 That one is like a person building a house, who dug deeply and laid the foundation on rock; when the flood came, the river burst against that house but could not shake it because it had been well built.

> 49 But the one who listens and does not act is like a person who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the river burst against it, it collapsed at once and was completely destroyed."

### Reflection:
In this Gospel, Jesus is talking with his disciples about bearing fruit. He tells them: “Good trees do not bear rotten fruit. Neither does a rotten tree bear good fruit.” Jesus continues on, saying: “People do not pick figs from thorn bushes, nor do they gather grapes from brambles.”

Jesus then says to his disciples: “Why do you call me ‘Lord’ but do not do what I command?” He then tells his disciples (and us) what the individual is like who “listens to his words, and acts on his words.” Jesus then describes how the man or woman who listens to Jesus and then acts would do. He likens this person to an individual who is building a house.

Naturally, the first step is to create a solid foundation for the house. This would be done by digging deeply into the earth and then laying the foundation on solid rock. Then when floods come, the house would not be shaken because it had such a strong and solid foundation. On the other hand, if a house is built on sand or ground that was not solid, when the river flooded, the house would not be able to withstand the assault. The house would collapse and it would be destroyed.

Today’s Gospel is an invitation to us from Jesus. He invites us to closely examine our “inner house.” As we do so, we might ask: is my inner ‘foundation’ strong? Has there been any erosion of my inner foundation? Do I strive to keep my inner foundation solid and secure?

Today and every day: Be mindful! Be alert! Erosion typically begins in small and imperceptible ways. If we don’t regularly monitor our inner foundation, one day we may wake up and find ourselves with a terrible inner flood, or that we have been washed downstream!
