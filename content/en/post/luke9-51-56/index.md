### Gospel
> 51 When the days for his being taken up were fulfilled, he resolutely determined to journey to Jerusalem,

> 52 and he sent messengers ahead of him. On the way they entered a Samaritan village to prepare for his reception there,

> 53 but they would not welcome him because the destination of his journey was Jerusalem.

> 54 When the disciples James and John saw this they asked, "Lord, do you want us to call down fire from heaven to consume them?"

> 55 Jesus turned and rebuked them,

> 56 and they journeyed to another village.

### Reflection:
Today’s Gospel reading is a foreshadowing of Jesus’s crucifixion and death. Jesus knew his arrest and death were likely, yet he held fast to his decision to travel to Jerusalem. He knew it was likely that he would be arrested. He also suspected that he might even die. Can you imagine the storm of emotions that must have been whirling around in Jesus’s mind and heart? Yet he decided to make the journey to Jerusalem.

Throughout the Gospels we see evidence of Jesus’s faith and trust in God. Today’s reading is a clear example of the depth of trust Jesus had in God. Do we have such faith? I hope so. We have to nurture our faith and trust in God each and every day. This creates a foundation and a relationship with God that will support and sustain us whenever we are in need. Today and every day let’s ask Jesus to deepen our trust and faith in him!
