### Gospel
> 1 On a sabbath he went to dine at the home of one of the leading Pharisees, and the people there were observing him carefully.

> 7 He told a parable to those who had been invited, noticing how they were choosing the places of honor at the table.

> 8 "When you are invited by someone to a wedding banquet, do not recline at table in the place of honor. A more distinguished guest than you may have been invited by him,

> 9 and the host who invited both of you may approach you and say, 'Give your place to this man,' and then you would proceed with embarrassment to take the lowest place.

> 10 Rather, when you are invited, go and take the lowest place so that when the host comes to you he may say, 'My friend, move up to a higher position.' Then you will enjoy the esteem of your companions at the table.

> 11 For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted."

### Reflection:
On the Sabbath, Jesus was invited to dine at the house of a prominent Pharisee.  There were other guests in attendance and they were intently observing Jesus.  When he arrived, Jesus had noticed how many of the guests had vied for places of honor at the table.  After a time, Jesus said to the guests: “When you are invited to a wedding banquet, do not sit in a place of honor at table.  It may happen that a guest deserving of a place of honor may arrive and need a seat of honor.  Thus, the host may approach you and ask you to give your place to the honored guest.  And you would experience the embarrassment of having to move down to a “lower” place.”

Jesus tells his listeners that it is better to take a lower place at table.  Then the host may come to you and say: "My friend, move up higher.”  The other guests then may hold you in high esteem.  Jesus concludes with the statement: “For everyone who exalts himself/herself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself/herself will be exalted.”

In today’s world, every day individuals vie for fame, fortune, power and status. The people who have achieved any of these “gifts” typically are held in high esteem.  However, Jesus completely reverses this idea.  He proposes that it always is best to choose a lower place rather than a higher place.  Thus, you will never be embarrassed by being asked to move  to a lower place.  And possibly you  may be invited to move up to a higher place.

Status-seeking is rampant in our world.  Many people seek fame, power and recognition.  However, there also are many individuals who live their lives quietly and simply.  They are content with God, family, friends and a simple lifestyle.  Fame may look glamorous.  However, almost every day in the newspaper or on television we hear stories of how the famous and the glamorous have fallen or been defamed, often by their own choices.

Today Jesus encourages us to be content with what seemingly is “lowly and least.”  Often it is in the  small and seemingly insignificant gifts of everyday life where we may experience the greatest love, joy, peace and contentment.  Today be mindful and notice the many small gifts you receive.  Thank the giver and thank God!
