### :love_letter: Gospel
> Then the whole assembly of them arose and brought him before Pilate. They brought charges against him, saying, “We found this man misleading our people; he opposes the payment of taxes to Caesar and maintains that he is the Messiah, a king.” Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” He said to him in reply, “You say so.” Pilate then addressed the chief priests and the crowds, “I find this man not guilty. But they were adamant and said, “He is inciting the people with his teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee where he began even to here.”

> On hearing this Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean; and upon learning that he was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod who was in Jerusalem at that time. Herod was very glad to see Jesus; he had been wanting to see him for a long time, for he had heard about him and had been hoping to see him perform some sign. He questioned him at length, but he gave him no answer. The chief priests and scribes, meanwhile, stood by accusing him harshly. [Even] Herod and his soldiers treated him contemptuously and mocked him, and after clothing him in resplendent garb, he sent him back to Pilate. Herod and Pilate became friends that very day, even though they had been enemies formerly. Pilate then summoned the chief priests, the rulers, and the people and said to them, “You brought this man to me and accused him of inciting the people to revolt. I have conducted my investigation in your presence and have not found this man guilty of the charges you have brought against him, nor did Herod, for he sent him back to us. So no capital crime has been committed by him. Therefore I shall have him flogged and then release him.”

> But all together they shouted out, “Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us.” (Now Barabbas had been imprisoned for a rebellion that had taken place in the city and for murder.) Again Pilate addressed them, still wishing to release Jesus, but they continued their shouting, “Crucify him! Crucify him!” Pilate addressed them a third time, “What evil has this man done? I found him guilty of no capital crime. Therefore I shall have him flogged and then release him.” With loud shouts, however, they persisted in calling for his crucifixion, and their voices prevailed. The verdict of Pilate was that their demand should be granted. So he released the man who had been imprisoned for rebellion and murder, for whom they asked, and he handed Jesus over to them to deal with as they wished.

> As they led him away they took hold of a certain Simon, a Cyrenian, who was coming in from the country; and after laying the cross on him, they made him carry it behind Jesus. A large crowd of people followed Jesus, including many women who mourned and lamented him. Jesus turned to them and said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep instead for yourselves and for your children, for indeed, the days are coming when people will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed.’ At that time people will say to the mountains, ‘Fall upon us!’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us!’ for if these things are done when the wood is green what will happen when it is dry?” Now two others, both criminals, were led away with him to be executed.

> When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him and the criminals there, one on his right, the other on his left. [Then Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.”] They divided his garments by casting lots. The people stood by and watched; the rulers, meanwhile, sneered at him and said, “He saved others, let him save himself if he is the chosen one, the Messiah of God.” Even the soldiers jeered at him. As they approached to offer him wine they called out, “If you are King of the Jews, save yourself.” Now one of the criminals hanging there reviled Jesus, saying, “Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us.” The other, however, rebuking him, said in reply, “Have you no fear of God, for you are subject to the same condemnation? And indeed, we have been condemned justly, for the sentence we received corresponds to our crimes, but this man has done nothing criminal.” Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.” He replied to him, “Amen, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.”

> It was now about noon and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon because of an eclipse of the sun. Then the veil of the temple was torn down the middle. Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Father, into your hands I commend my spirit”; and when he had said this he breathed his last. The centurion who witnessed what had happened glorified God and said, “This man was innocent beyond doubt.” When all the people who had gathered for this spectacle saw what had happened, they returned home beating their breasts; but all his acquaintances stood at a distance, including the women who had followed him from Galilee and saw these events.

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
In today’s Liturgy, we face quite a contrast of experiences and emotions.  We begin our celebration listening to the story of Jesus being welcomed into Jerusalem with great joy and exultation!  “Hosanna!” they cried out.
 “Hosanna in the Highest!”  Jesus was treated as He should have been treated.  People were excited to see Him and there was much excitement.

But this excitement quickly turned to shock and horror as we enter more deeply into today’s readings.  The Gospel culminates with Jesus hanging on the Cross crying out “Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?” “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”  And with that, “Jesus gave a loud cry and breathed his last.”  At that moment the entire congregation kneels in silence as we ponder the reality of Christ’s death.

How things can change in one short week.  What happened to all the people who were shouting and praising Him as He entered into Jerusalem?  How could they allow Him to enter into this Crucifixion and death?

The deepest answer to this question is one that we may not expect.  The answer is that the Father willed it.  The Father willed, by His permissive will, that so many would turn on Him, abandon Him and allow Him to be crucified.  This is so very important to understand.  

At any time during that first Holy Week, Jesus could have exercised His divine power and refused to embrace His Cross.  But He didn’t.  Instead, He willingly walked through this week anticipating and embracing the suffering and rejection He received.  And He didn’t do so begrudgingly or even with regret.  He embraced this week willingly, choosing it as His own will.

Why would He do such a thing?  Why would He choose suffering and death?  Because in the Father’s perfect wisdom, this suffering and death was for a greater purpose.  God chose to confound the wisdom of the world by using His own suffering and Crucifixion as the perfect means of our holiness.  In this act, He transformed the greatest evil into the greatest good.  Now, as a result of our faith in this act, the crucifix hangs centrally in our churches and in our homes as a constant reminder that not even the greatest of evils can overcome the power, wisdom and love of God.  God is more powerful than death itself and God has the final victory even when all seems lost.

Let this week give you divine hope.  So often we can be tempted toward discouragement and, even worse, we can be tempted toward despair.  But all is not lost for us either.  Nothing can ultimately steal away our joy unless we let it.  No hardship, no burden and no cross can conquer us if we remain steadfast in Christ Jesus letting Him transform all we endure in life by His glorious embrace of His own Cross.

### :latin_cross: Meditation
Reflect, today, upon the contrast of emotions from Palm Sunday through Good Friday.  Ponder the fear, confusion and despair that many would have had as they saw Jesus murdered.  Reflect, also, upon this being a divine act by which the Father permitted this grave suffering so as to use it for the greatest good ever known.  The Lord gave His life freely and calls you to do the same.  Reflect upon the cross in your life.  Know that the Lord can use this for good, bringing forth an abundance of mercy through your free embrace as you offer it to Him as a willing sacrifice.  Blessed Holy Week!  Put your eyes upon the Lord’s Cross as well as your own.

### :pray: Prayer
My crucified Lord, when I am tempted to despair, give me hope.  Help me to see your presence in all things, even in those things that are most troubling to me.  May this Holy Week transform my darkest moments and weakness as I surrender all to You, my God.  Jesus, I trust in You.
