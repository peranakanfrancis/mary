“Mary arose and went with haste.” (Luke 1:39).
“Why am I so honored that the mother of my Lord should visit me?” (Luke 1:43).

“What is more, your relative Elizabeth has become pregnant in her old age! People used to say she was barren, but she has conceived a son and is now in her sixth month. For the word of God will never fail. For nothing is impossible with God. (Luke 1:36 – 37).

On hearing this good news, Mary went with haste to visit Elizabeth. To be with her help her in her late pregnancy and the birth of John the Baptist.
“She entered the house and greeted Elizabeth. At the sound of Mary’s greeting, Elizabeth’s child leaped within her, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
Elizabeth gave a glad cry and exclaimed to Mary. “God has blessed you above all women, and your child is blessed. Why am I so honored, that the mother of my Lord should visit me? (Luke 1:40-43).
In visiting Elizabeth, Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus began Her ministry of visitation to every generation of Christians. “From now on all generations will call me blessed.” (Luke 1:48).
Mary will bring the Lord Jesus, Her dearly loved son with Her. To teach, rescue, heal and forgive us. And to equip us with the gifts and power of the Holy Spirit to prosper and succeed in all we do.

_O God_
_I thank you with all my heart_
_For Holy Mary, Mother of God_
_Who always come with haste to visit me._
_To help me when I need is most._
_Bringing with Her, The Lord Jesus Christ, Her dearly loved son._
_To teach, rescue, forgive and heal me,_
_And empower me with the gifts_
_And power of the Holy Spirit_
_To prosper and succeed in all I do._

“Why am I so honored, that the mother of my Lord should visit me?” (Luke 1:43).
