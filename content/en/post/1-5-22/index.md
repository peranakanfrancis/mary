### :love_letter: Gospel
> After this, Jesus revealed himself again to his disciples at the Sea of Tiberias. He revealed himself in this way. Together were Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, Zebedee’s sons, and two others of his disciples. Simon Peter said to them, “I am going fishing.” They said to him, “We also will come with you.” So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.

> When it was already dawn, Jesus was standing on the shore; but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus. Jesus said to them, “Children, have you caught anything to eat?” They answered him, “No.” So he said to them, “Cast the net over the right side of the boat and you will find something.” So they cast it, and were not able to pull it in because of the number of fish. So the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord.” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he tucked in his garment, for he was lightly clad, and jumped into the sea. The other disciples came in the boat, for they were not far from shore, only about a hundred yards, dragging the net with the fish.

> When they climbed out on shore, they saw a charcoal fire with fish on it and bread. Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish you just caught.” So Simon Peter went over and dragged the net ashore full of one hundred fifty-three large fish. Even though there were so many, the net was not torn. Jesus said to them, “Come, have breakfast.” And none of the disciples dared to ask him, “Who are you?” because they realized it was the Lord. Jesus came over and took the bread and gave it to them, and in like manner the fish. This was now the third time Jesus was revealed to his disciples after being raised from the dead.

> When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” He said to him, “Feed my lambs.” He then said to him a second time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” He said to him, “Tend my sheep.” He said to him the third time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” Peter was distressed that he had said to him a third time, “Do you love me?” and he said to him, “Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, “Feed my sheep. Amen, amen, I say to you, when you were younger, you used to dress yourself and go where you wanted; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.” He said this signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. And when he had said this, he said to him, “Follow me.”

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
Peter was all in, literally speaking.  This passage above is taken from one of the appearances of Jesus to the Apostles after His Resurrection.  They were fishing all night and caught nothing.  Jesus, from the shore, told them to cast the net off the right side of the boat.  When they did this they caught more fish than they could handle.  When John realized it was Jesus and said so, Peter could not contain his excitement and jumped into the water to go and meet his Lord.

What a wonderful image this is to reflect upon.  Specifically, it’s wonderful to consider the interior excitement of Peter that led him to jump into the water and swim to the shore.  His excitement could not be contained.

Would you jump into a lake to go to our Lord?  That may seem like an unusual question but it’s worth considering in a literal way.  If you encountered our resurrected Lord, would you be so excited to see Him that you would be compelled to enter into His presence, even if it meant you had to jump into a lake?  This action of Peter should be seen as a symbolic gesture for our own spiritual lives.  The fact that Peter did not hesitate reveals how we should react when we encounter Jesus.

Obviously we do not encounter Jesus in His resurrected form in the way Peter did in this passage, literally and physically.  But we do encounter Him every day, if we only have eyes to see.  He is alive within our own hearts through prayer and by His indwelling presence. He is truly present in the people we meet every day.   And He is most certainly present in the Sacraments, especially the Most Holy Eucharist.  

There are two questions you should consider regarding this passage.  The first is whether or not you actually do perceive Jesus’ presence throughout the day.  Peter did not recognize Him at first, even though Jesus spoke to him and the others in the boat.  It took the miracle for them to recognize it was Him.  The second question is how you react to His presence when you do perceive Him.  Are you indifferent?  Do you lack enthusiasm?  Or are you filled with much joy?

### :latin_cross: Meditation
Reflect, today, upon these two questions and resolve to become more attentive to the presence of our Lord every day, throughout the day.  Resolve, also, to react as Peter did when you see Jesus.  Let your heart and passion be drawn to Him and react with extraordinary joy and enthusiasm.  Don’t be afraid to go all in for our Lord!

### :pray: Prayer
Lord, help me to see You, alive in my life, alive in the lives of others, and alive in Your Church, especially in the Most Holy Eucharist.  So often I am blind to Your divine presence all around me.  Help me to see You every day.  Help me also to respond with much joy and enthusiasm to Your divine presence.  I love You, dear Lord.  Help me to love You more.  Jesus, I trust in You.
