Praying aloud the Rosary, the monotonous rhythm is therapeutic, it helps to “Be still in the presence of the Lord, and wait patiently for Him to act.” (Psalm 37:7).

1. When we are in the hospital waiting.

A. For the dear one undergoing a major operation.

B. For the dear one to recover from unconsciousness/coma.

C. For an appointment.

2. When accompanying the dear one at the hour of death.

3. When in fear and anxiety.
