Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger by the way you treat them, rather, bring them up with the discipline and instruction that comes from the Lord. (Ephesians 6:4).

Jesus died with a prayer on His lips “Father, I entrust my spirit into your hands.” (Luke 23:46). Mary, like every Jewish Mother, taught her child Jesus to pray this prayer before lay down to sleep.

St. Paul reminds Timothy to be thankful for the genuine faith he has inherited from his family. “I remember your genuine faith, for you share the faith that first filled your grandmother Lois and your mother, Eunice, and I know that same faith continues strong in you. (2 Timothy 1:5).

Parents have the responsibility and privilege of evangelizing their children. Education in the Faith by parents should begin in the child’s earliest years. It precedes the Parish Sunday Catechism.

As the child begins to learn to talk, point to the Crucifix or Icon of the Divine Mercy, encourage the child to cry out “Jesus”.

When the child is older, read to the child bedtime bible stories. Like David and Goliath (1 Samuel 17:32-50) and Samson and Delilah (Judges 16:4-31). Kneel down with the child to lead the child in night prayer, ask the child to repeat after you:  Jesus, thank you, for A Happy Day, bless daddy; bless mummy.

When the child is preparing for First Holy Communion start to share with the child every good thing, no matter how big, or how small, that God has done in your life.

The greatest inheritance parents can give to their children is an effective hope and trust in God.
