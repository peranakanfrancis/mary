### Gospel
> 37 Everything that the Father gives me will come to me, and I will not reject anyone who comes to me,

> 38 because I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of the one who sent me.

> 39 And this is the will of the one who sent me, that I should not lose anything of what he gave me, but that I should raise it (on) the last day.

> 40 For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in him may have eternal life, and I shall raise him (on) the last day."

### Reflection
On the 2nd day of November, the Catholic Church celebrates the feast of “The Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed.”    This feast often is called the “Feast of All Souls.”  This is the Church’s day to remember and pray for all of the people who have gone before us.

Today I invite you to take some extra time to remember and pray for the significant individuals in your life who have left this world.   They may be family members, friends or individuals who made a significant difference in your life.  What impact did these men and women have in your life?  Today take time to remember each one of these special individuals.  Remember their smile and their care for you.  Trust that these beloved individuals are still watching over you and perhaps today, they may be interceding on your behalf with God.

Take time to thank God, Jesus and the Spirit for gifting you with these special individuals.  And when you have moved on to heaven, trust that you also will be remembered with great love and prayer by your family and friends!
