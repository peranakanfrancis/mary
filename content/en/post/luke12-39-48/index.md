### Gospel
> 39 Be sure of this: if the master of the house had known the hour when the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into.

> 40 You also must be prepared, for at an hour you do not expect, the Son of Man will come."

> 41 Then Peter said, "Lord, is this parable meant for us or for everyone?"

> 42 And the Lord replied, "Who, then, is the faithful and prudent steward whom the master will put in charge of his servants to distribute (the) food allowance at the proper time?

> 43 Blessed is that servant whom his master on arrival finds doing so.

> 44 Truly, I say to you, he will put him in charge of all his property.

> 45 But if that servant says to himself, 'My master is delayed in coming,' and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants, to eat and drink and get drunk,

> 46 then that servant's master will come on an unexpected day and at an unknown hour and will punish him severely and assign him a place with the unfaithful.

> 47 That servant who knew his master's will but did not make preparations nor act in accord with his will shall be beaten severely;

> 48 and the servant who was ignorant of his master's will but acted in a way deserving of a severe beating shall be beaten only lightly. Much will be required of the person entrusted with much, and still more will be demanded of the person entrusted with more.

### Reflection:
Today Jesus tells his disciples: “Be sure of this: if the master of the hour had known when the thief would come, he would have not let his house be broken into.”  Jesus then instructs his disciples always to be prepared for the coming of the Son of Man.  He will come at an unexpected time!  There will not be an announcement of his arrival.  He simply will appear when he wishes.

The question is: Will we be ready when the Son of Man comes to us?  Jesus comes to us in many ways every day.  He is at our side when we are struggling or in pain (be that physical or emotional pain).  He also is with us when life is good and peaceful.  He is present to us as we go about our humdrum day.  However, we have to be awake and alert to His presence.  If we are not looking for his presence we may miss His quiet, peaceful and loving presence.   

Pause for a moment and ask yourself: Do you strive to be awake and alert to the myriad ways Jesus may appear to you today?  It may be during your prayer time.  Perhaps you experience his presence when you receive a phone call from a friend you have not heard from recently.  Or it may be when you are enjoying time with your family.  Most likely, Jesus will appear to us in quiet and subtle ways.  Strive to be awake and alert today.  Jesus will come to us.  The question is: will we be awake enough to notice his presence?
