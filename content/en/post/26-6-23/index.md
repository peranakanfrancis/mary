> “And each morning and evening they stood before the lord to sing songs of thanks and praise to Him.” (1 Chronicles 23:30).

No matter what we pray for, thanksgiving can always go with it.
A good habit to develop is starting all our prayers with thanksgiving and example of this would be, “Thank you, Lord Jesus Christ, for all you have done in my Life. You are awesome and I really love and appreciate you.”
I encourage you to examine your life, to pay attention to your thoughts and your words, and to see how much thanksgiving you express. Do you murmur and complain about things or are you thankful?
If you want a challenge, just try to get through an entire day without uttering one word of complaint.
Develop an attitude of thanksgiving in every situation.

In fact, just become outrageously thankful, and watch as your intimacy with the Lord Jesus Christ increases and as He pours out greater blessings than ever before.

### Prayers of Thanks
Lord Jesus Christ
I thank you for the way you guide me in prayer.
Help me to come to you in thanksgiving, before I do anything else.
Let gratitude to be the foundation of my prayer life.
I make the decision today to put aside complaining, being thankful in prayer instead.
