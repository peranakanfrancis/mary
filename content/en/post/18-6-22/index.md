> “No one can serve two masters. He will either hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.

> “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink, or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing?

> Look at the birds in the sky; they do not sow or reap, they gather nothing into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are not you more important than they? Can any of you by worrying add a single moment to your life-span? Why are you anxious about clothes?

> Learn from the way the wild flowers grow. They do not work or spin. But I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was clothed like one of them. If God so clothes the grass of the field, which grows today and is thrown into the oven tomorrow, will he not much more provide for you, O you of little faith? So do not worry and say, ‘What are we to eat?’ or ‘What are we to drink?’ or ‘What are we to wear?’ All these things the pagans seek. Your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be given you besides.

> Do not worry about tomorrow; tomorrow will take care of itself. Sufficient for a day is its own evil.

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
This is advice that we all need to hear. But, as the saying goes, “It’s easier said than done.”

Worrying can become for some people just a normal part of life.  The things we worry about each and every day can include a myriad of concerns.  Finances, relationships, work, family, health and many other things in life can be the cause of much worrying, fear, anxiety and even depression.  Excessive worrying can truly become a heavy burden if not handled properly.

So what is the proper way to deal with the things you worry about?  Trust.
 Trust in God, in His fidelity, in His all-consuming love for you, and in His providence.  He loves you and is concerned about you more than you will ever know.  And He is aware of every detail and problem you may face.

If we truly understood the love of God and His infinite wisdom, we would not worry about a thing.  We would be able to trust and surrender all to Him every day and we would allow Him to enter in and to direct us in hope according to His perfect plan for our lives.  But, as mentioned above, this is easier said than done.

Another key factor in overcoming the worries and anxieties of life is to seek the Truth.  Knowing the truth frees us and it enables us to see the hand of God at work even in the most difficult of situations.  God never abandons us even though it may feel like that at times.  If we can seek out His voice, His will, His wisdom and His truth, it will be much easier to place our trust in Him.  And when we place our trust in Him, we find peace in our soul and feel the heavy weight of our worry lift away.

### :latin_cross: Meditation
Reflect, today, upon that which you worry about the most.  It may be an extremely heavy and burdensome fear.  Or, it may just be this constant thought in the back of your mind.  Whatever the case may be for you, try to identify that which seems to burden you the most and is the greatest source of concern.  Then try to seek God’s truth as it applies to your situation so that you can then surrender in trust to His perfect plan for your life.

### :pray: Prayer
Lord of perfect wisdom, I do trust in You, but I also fail to trust enough.  When the burdens and worries of life weigh me down, help me to surrender those concerns over to You.  Jesus, I trust in You.
