Today, the 2nd Sunday of Advent in the New Liturgical year, St. Mark begins to tell us His story of “The God News about Jesus the Messiah, The Son of God”. (Mark 1:1).

“He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.” (Mark 1:8).

The Holy Spirit will bring home to us the liberating power of the teachings of the Lord Jesus and the healing power of His love.

Advent celebrates the fresh coming/visitation of the Lord Jesus Christ into our lives. 

“Look! I stand at the door and knock. If you hear my voice and open the door, I will come in, and we will share a meal together as friends” (Revelation 3:20).

 Let us open the door of our heart to welcome the Lord Jesus Christ in.
“Amen! Come, Lord Jesus” (Revelation 22:20).

And “Sat at the Lord’s feet listening to what He taught” (Luke 10:39).
And “He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit” (Mark 1:8).

To give us a fresh understanding and experience of the teachings and the stories of the Lord Jesus healing the sicks and casting out demons.

To fill us with great joy and strong courage to face the New Year 2024.

### Prayer
Lord Jesus Christ.
As I listen and read the Gospel of Mark in the new Liturgical year, Baptize me with the Holy Spirit. To give a fresh understanding and experience of the teachings and stories of the Lord Jesus healing the sicks and casting out Demons.
To empower me to live a rich and satisfying life in 2024. Amen.

Glory be to the Father
And to the Son
And to the Holy Spirit.
As it was in the beginning,
Is now and ever shall be,
World without end. Amen.
