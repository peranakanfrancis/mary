“I bring you good news that will bring great joy to all people. The saviour, yes, the Messiah, the Lord has been born today in Bethlehem, the city of David.” Luke  2:10-11

Look!  I stand at the door and knock. If you hear my voice and open the door, I will come in, and we will share a meal together as friends. Revelation 3:20

Jesus knocks at the door of  our hearts. Because He wants to save us and have fellowship with us.

He is patient and persistent in trying to get through to us, not breaking and entering, but knocking.

He allows us to decide whether or not to open our lives to Him.
Do I intentionally keep His life changing presence and power on the other side of the door ?
“Amen！Come Lord Jesus”. Revelation. 20:24
“My Lord and My God!” John 21:28

Wishing you..
A Blessed and Joy filled Christmas. 
And a Happy, Rich and Satisfyng New Year 2024.
