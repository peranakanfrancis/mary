### :love_letter: Gospel
> After John had been arrested, Jesus came to Galilee proclaiming the gospel of God: “This is the time of fulfillment. The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel.”

> As he passed by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting their nets into the sea; they were fishermen. Jesus said to them, “Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men. Then they abandoned their nets and followed him. He walked along a little farther and saw James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They too were in a boat mending their nets. Then he called them. So they left their father Zebedee in the boat along with the hired men and followed him.

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
Christmas season is now completed and we enter into the First Week in Ordinary Time.  It’s time to return to the “ordinary” of life.  But is the Christian life ordinary?  Is there anything truly “ordinary” about following Jesus?

Today’s Gospel reveals the extraordinary and radical call from Jesus to follow Him.  Simon and Andrew are the two who respond to the call in this passage, but their response is also an invitation to all of us to step out of the ordinary and into the extraordinary.

This passage especially reveals two things: 1) the immediate response of these Apostles, and 2) their complete response.  They clearly did not hold back or hesitate in responding to the invitation from Jesus to follow Him.

What about you?  Do you hear Jesus calling you?  Do you hear Him speak to you, calling you to come after Him?  Hopefully, as our Lord speaks to each one of us, we will respond immediately and in a complete way.  Hopefully we will not hesitate to embrace the glorious calling we each have been given.  

### :latin_cross: Meditation
Reflect, today, upon the fact that you, too, have been called to an extraordinary life of grace which requires total abandonment and commitment.  You have been called to respond immediately and freely to Jesus’ invitation.  As you begin this liturgical season of Ordinary Time, jump into the extraordinary life of grace and embrace it with your whole heart.

### :pray: Prayer
Lord, I love You and thank You for the extraordinary life of grace You have called me to live.  Help me to respond to Your invitation with complete submission of my mind and will.  Jesus, I trust in You.
