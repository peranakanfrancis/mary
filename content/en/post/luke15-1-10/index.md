### Gospel
> 1 The tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to listen to him,

> 2 but the Pharisees and scribes began to complain, saying, "This man welcomes sinners and eats with them."

> 3 So to them he addressed this parable.

> 4 "What man among you having a hundred sheep and losing one of them would not leave the ninety-nine in the desert and go after the lost one until he finds it?

> 5 And when he does find it, he sets it on his shoulders with great joy

> 6 and, upon his arrival home, he calls together his friends and neighbors and says to them, 'Rejoice with me because I have found my lost sheep.'

> 7 I tell you, in just the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance.

> 8 "Or what woman having ten coins and losing one would not light a lamp and sweep the house, searching carefully until she finds it?

> 9 And when she does find it, she calls together her friends and neighbors and says to them, 'Rejoice with me because I have found the coin that I lost.'

> 10 In just the same way, I tell you, there will be rejoicing among the angels of God over one sinner who repents."

### Reflection:
Today Jesus is surrounded by sinners and tax collectors.  They had gathered around Jesus to listen to him preach.  There were many Pharisees and scribes also in the crowd.  After a time, they began to complain.  They said: “This man welcomes sinners.  Not only does Jesus welcome sinners, he also eats with them.”  Naturally, Jesus clearly heard their comments (as the Pharisees had intended).

Jesus then addressed a parable to them:  “If a shepherd has 100 sheep and one of the sheep wanders off and gets lost, would the shepherd not leave the 99 sheep to go and find the lost sheep?”  Jesus then continues:  “And when the shepherd finds the lost sheep, will he not put the lost sheep on his shoulders and lovingly carry it back home, and share this good news with his family and friends?”

Jesus changes course and uses another example: “What woman having ten coins and then losing one of the coins, would not light a lamp and search her home looking for the precious coin?  And when the woman finds the coin, will she not call her relatives and neighbors and say: ‘Come and rejoice with me!  I have found the precious coin that I had lost!’”  Jesus then says to his listeners: “In the same way, there will be great rejoicing among the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”

Ask yourself: How many times in your life have you wandered away from Jesus?  I assume all of us have done, at the very least, some minor wandering away from Jesus.  However, there also may have been times in our lives when we were estranged from Jesus.  This may have been caused by a tragedy in your life, perhaps the loss of a loved one, the loss of work, financial problems, or perhaps estrangement from a loved one.   Or perhaps over time you became disenchanted with Jesus.

Today I invite you to be mindful of the individuals you encounter today who might be a considered an outsider or a “lost sheep.”  The person may be a homeless man or woman.  Or perhaps it is an older neighbor who lives alone, someone who would appreciate some of your time and attention.  Or it may be a family member who lives on the fringe of the family system.  And also ask yourself: In what way/s might I be considered an outsider by the people in my life?   

Jesus loves and values every person on this planet (and perhaps other planets)!  Jesus does not look at an individual’s talents, intelligence, salary, or status.  Each and every individual is loved and cherished by Jesus.

Jesus calls us to follow him, to live as he did.  Today will we consciously choose to follow in his footsteps?  If we decide to do so, we may give another person a loving and special gift!
