In responsibility for each other, as disciples of the Lord, we pray for one another.

1. St. Paul prayed for the Thessalonian believers.
We always thank God for all of you and pray for you constantly.
As we pray to our God and Father about you, we think of your faithful work, your loving deeds, and the enduring hope you have because of our Lord Jesus Christ.
(1 Thessalonians 1:2-3)

2. St. Paul requested for prayer.
Finally, dear brothers and sisters, we ask you to pray for us.
Pray that the Lordâ€™s message will spread rapidly and be honoured wherever it goes, just as when it came to you. Pray too, that we will be rescued from wicked and evil people, for not everyone is a believer. (2 Thessalonians 3:1-2)

We often hear about a prayer need or think about a situation and say to ourselves, I need to pray about that later when I pray. That thought is a stall tactic of the devil. Why not pray right that minute? Procrastination is one of the major things that the devil uses to keep us from ever doing the right thing. Never put off until later what you can do right now.

Prayer would be easy if we just followed our hearts, but Satan wants us to procrastinate because He is hoping that we will forget the matter entirely.

A grateful heart is already focused on the Lord and ready to pray at any moment. Praying as we sense the desire or need to pray is easy to do, and it is the way we can pray continually and stay connected to God in every situation throughout the day.

Prayer of Thanks
O Lord, I thank you for the power of prayer. When there is a prayer need that comes to my attention, I am going to talk to you about it immediately. Thank you that you are always ready to hear my prayer.
