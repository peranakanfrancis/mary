### Gospel
> As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him. While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew’s house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples. When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” On hearing this, Jesus said, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. But go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”

### Reflection
Aside from Matthew whom Jesus called to follow Him we too are being called by the Lord. We may say that we are not worthy to follow Jesus but who amongst us are worthy? No one for we are all sinful creatures of this world.

Matthew was called by Jesus to follow Him for the precise reason that he was a sinner. This is the character and mission of Jesus to call every sinner to follow Him. But why is it that even if we know that we are called to repentance we still continue to sin? We refuse to leave behind us our sinful ways.

This is indeed very puzzling, why is it that many of us ignore Jesus call for us to follow Him? Does this mean that we love this world more than we love Jesus? Does this mean that Jesus is losing influence over us and the devil is slowly but surely gaining control of our lives that is why we refuse to heed Jesus’ call to a life of renewal and repentance?

Why did Matthew follow Jesus call? Perhaps somebody had shared to him the love and unfathomable mercy of Jesus. Somebody had lived his faith in Jesus and Matthew heard and saw it, that’s why it was not anymore difficult for Matthew to recognize and follow Jesus.

The challenge before us is to share and live our faith in Jesus to the many Matthews (Sinners) of our time. They may not have heard yet anything about Jesus that is why they keep on sinning until this very day. Why not share the mercy and love of Jesus?

Would you share Jesus?
