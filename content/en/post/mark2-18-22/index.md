### :love_letter: Gospel
> The disciples of John and of the Pharisees were accustomed to fast. People came to him and objected, “Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?”

> Jesus answered them, “Can the wedding guests fast* while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast. But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast on that day.

> No one sews a piece of unshrunken cloth on an old cloak. If he does, its fullness pulls away, the new from the old, and the tear gets worse. Likewise, no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins are ruined. Rather, new wine is poured into fresh wineskins.”

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
We’ve all heard this analogy from Jesus before.  It’s one of those statements that we can easily hear and then dismiss without comprehending.  Do you understand what it means?  

This analogy is followed by the analogy of pouring new wine into old wineskins.  Jesus states that no one does this because it will burst the old wineskins.  Therefore, new wine is poured into new wineskins.

Both of these analogies speak to the same spiritual truth.  They reveal that if we wish to receive His new and transforming Gospel message, we must first become new creations.  Our old lives of sin cannot contain the new gift of grace.  Therefore, in order to fully receive the message of Jesus, we must first become created anew.

Recall the Scripture: “To the one who has, more will be given; from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away” (Mark 4:25).  This teaches a similar message.  When we are filled with the newness of grace, we are graced all the more.

What is that “new wine” and “new patch” that Jesus desires to give you?  If you are willing to let your life be made new, you will discover that more will be poured upon you as you receive more.  Abundance will be given when abundance has already been received.  It’s as if someone won the lotto and decided to give it all away to the wealthiest person he can find.  This is how grace works.  But the good news is that God desires that all of us become spiritually rich in abundance.

### :latin_cross: Meditation
Reflect, today, upon this teaching of Jesus.  Know that He wants to pour an abundance of grace into your life if you are willing to let yourself be first created anew.  

### :pray: Prayer
My Lord of all generosity, I desire to be made anew.  I desire to live a new life in grace so that even more grace can be lavished upon me through Your sacred words.  Help me, dear Lord, to embrace the life of abundance that You have in store for me.  Jesus, I trust in You.
