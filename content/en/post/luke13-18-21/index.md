### Gospel
> 18 Then he said, "What is the kingdom of God like? To what can I compare it?

> 19 It is like a mustard seed that a person took and planted in the garden. When it was fully grown, it became a large bush and 'the birds of the sky dwelt in its branches.'"

> 20 Again he said, "To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?

> 21 It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed (in) with three measures of wheat flour until the whole batch of dough was leavened."

### Reflection:
Today’s Gospel begins with Jesus teaching in the synagogue.  At one point he asked his listeners: “What is the Kingdom of God like?  To what can I compare it?”  Then Jesus describes the Kingdom of God by using different images. He tells the people: “The Kingdom of God is like a mustard seed that a man planted in the garden.  When the seed was fully grown, it had many branches and the birds would come and dwell in its branches.”

Jesus then gives them another example to describe the Kingdom of God.  He tells the people: “The Kingdom of God is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with wheat flour until the whole batch of dough was leavened.”   What was Jesus trying to say to his listeners (and to us)?

Perhaps today Jesus is reminding us that we are called to be “leaven” in today’s world.  As Christians, we are called to share the love of Jesus with every person we meet.  The gift is there is a multitude of ways to be leaven in our world.  It may be by sharing a smile, offering to help someone with their grocery bags,  being a “listening ear” for a friend or family member who is struggling, or laughing with a friend who is struggling.

Today Jesus is telling us that the Kingdom of God is in our midst!  Today will we build up the Kingdom of God or will we ignore it?  The question is: will we be “leaven” in our corner of the world?  Only we can decide!
