### :love_letter: Gospel
> After this he went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the customs post. He said to him, “Follow me.” And leaving everything behind, he got up and followed him.

> Then Levi gave a great banquet for him in his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were at table with them. The Pharisees and their scribes complained to his disciples, saying, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”

> Jesus said to them in reply, “Those who are healthy do not need a physician, but the sick do. I have not come to call the righteous to repentance but sinners.”

### :speech_balloon: Reflection:
What would a doctor do without patients?  What if no one were sick?  The poor doctor would be out of business.  Therefore, in a sense, it’s fair to say that a doctor needs the sick in order to fulfill his role.

The same could be said of Jesus.  He is the Savior of the World.  But what if there were no sinners?  Then Jesus’ death would have been in vain, and His mercy would not be necessary.  Therefore, in a sense, we can conclude that Jesus, as the Savior of the World, needs sinners.  He needs those who have turned away from Him, violated the Divine Law, violated their own dignity, violated the dignity of others and acted in a selfish and sinful way.  Jesus needs sinners.  Why?  Because Jesus is the Savior, and a Savior needs to save.  A Savior needs those who need to be saved in order to save!

This is important to understand, because when we do, we will suddenly realize that coming to Jesus, with the filth of our sin, brings great joy to His Heart.  It brings joy, because He is able to fulfill the mission given Him by the Father, exercising His mercy as the one and only Savior.  

Allow Jesus to fulfill His mission!  Let Him offer mercy to you!  You do this by admitting your need for mercy.  You do this by coming to Him in a vulnerable and sinful state, unworthy of mercy and worthy only of eternal damnation.  Coming to Jesus in this way allows Him to fulfill the mission given Him by the Father.  It allows Him to manifest, in a concrete way, His Heart of abundant mercy.  Jesus “needs” you to fulfill His mission.  Give Him this gift and let Him be your merciful Savior.

### :latin_cross: Meditation
Reflect, today, upon the mercy of God from a new perspective.  Look at it from the perspective of Jesus as the Divine Physician who desires to fulfill His healing mission.  Realize that He needs you in order to fulfill His mission.  He needs you to admit your sin and be open to His healing.  In so doing, you allow the gates of mercy to pour forth in abundance in our day and age.

### :pray: Prayer
Dear Savior and Divine Physician, I thank You for coming to save and heal.  I thank You for Your burning desire to manifest Your mercy in my life.  Please humble me so that I may be open to Your healing touch and that, through this gift of salvation, I allow You to manifest Your Divine Mercy.  Jesus, I trust in You.
