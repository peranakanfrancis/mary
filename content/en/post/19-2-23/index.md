1. A) May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands, for the praise and glory of His name for our good and the good of all His Holy Church.

   B) “Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of His death and resurrection, we offer You, Lord, the Bread of life, and the chalice of Salvation.” (Eucharistic Prayer II).

  C) “Therefore, let us offer through Jesus a continual sacrifice of praise to God, proclaiming our allegiance to His name.” (Hebrews 13:15).

2. Prayer before Mass: Intention for the Mass
    Almighty Father,
    I offer you, the body and blood, soul and divinity of your dearly beloved son, Our 
    Lord, Jesus Christ for _________.

3. Prayer at the Doxology, the summit of the Mass. The moment of offering the 
    Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, the sacrificial Body and Blood of Christ. When the
    Priest takes the chalice and the paten with the Host, and raising both he says:
    Through Him, and with Him, and in Him, O God, Almighty Father. All Glory and 
    Honour is yours, for ever and ever.

    Bow slightly say: Almighty Father, I offer you, the Body and Blood, Soul and 
    Divinity, of your dearly beloved son, Our Lord Jesus Christ for ____.

    “Through the mediation of Jesus Christ, you offer spiritual sacrifices that please God.” (1 Peter 2:5).
