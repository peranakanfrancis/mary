### :love_letter: Gospel
> He was driving out a demon [that was] mute, and when the demon had gone out, the mute person spoke and the crowds were amazed. Some of them said, “By the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons, he drives out demons.” Others, to test him, asked him for a sign from heaven.

> But he knew their thoughts and said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself will be laid waste and house will fall against house. And if Satan is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that it is by Beelzebul that I drive out demons. If I, then, drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your own people drive them out? Therefore they will be your judges. But if it is by the finger of God that [I] drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.

> When a strong man fully armed guards his palace, his possessions are safe. But when one stronger* than he attacks and overcomes him, he takes away the armor on which he relied and distributes the spoils.

> Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
What hinders you from speaking the Word of God openly, honestly and clearly?  There are so many people who are in dire need of the Gospel.
There are so many people who are confused in life and find themselves walking down the wrong road, a road leading to greater confusion and destruction.  And we remain silent as they travel this road.  Why?

The Gospel above speaks of a man who was mute as a result of a demon.  When this demon was driven out by Jesus, the mute man spoke and many were amazed.  Most likely this man was fully possessed by this demon and the oppression he experienced disabled his ability to even speak.
Upon his release from this demonic influence, he spoke freely.

Though we may not experience demonic influence to the same degree, we are often hindered and oppressed by similar mute spirits.  The evil one often tries to influence us in such a way that we are fearful of proclaiming the Gospel freely, sincerely and immediately to those who are in most need of the message God wants communicated to them.  “Mute spirits” can often hinder us, confuse us or fill us with a certain fear when the opportunity arises to share our faith with another.  Though it may be rare to fall completely into their power, we are often left influenced and hindered by them nonetheless.

### :latin_cross: Meditation
Reflect, today, upon the reality of these vile spirits and their attempts to silence us, keeping us from speaking the message of truth that so many people need to hear.  We ought not fear their influence.  Jesus has complete power over all such spirits and will not hesitate to silence their influence over us if we let Him.  He wants to free us to speak His message of love without reserve so that others will come to know Him and His perfect love.  Let Him use you as one such instrument of truth and love.

### :pray: Prayer
Eternal Word of God, at times I am given over to fear when You call me to speak Your words of love to those in need.  I feel as though I am muted in my speech, confused about what to say.  Please free me, dear Lord, to be a holy instrument of Your Word and to confidently proclaim Your truth to those who are in much need.  Jesus, I trust in You.
