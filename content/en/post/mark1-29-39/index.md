### :love_letter: Gospel
> On leaving the synagogue he entered the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John. Simon’s mother-in-law lay sick with a fever. They immediately told him about her. He approached, grasped her hand, and helped her up. Then the fever left her and she waited on them.

> When it was evening, after sunset, they brought to him all who were ill or possessed by demons. The whole town was gathered at the door. He cured many who were sick with various diseases, and he drove out many demons, not permitting them to speak because they knew him.

> Rising very early before dawn, he left and went off to a deserted place, where he prayed. Simon and those who were with him pursued him and on finding him said, “Everyone is looking for you.” He told them, “Let us go on to the nearby villages that I may preach there also. For this purpose have I come.” So he went into their synagogues, preaching and driving out demons throughout the whole of Galilee.

### :speech_balloon: Reflection
Why did Jesus come?  What was the purpose of His life on Earth?  This passage reveals that He came to preach to all people the Good News.  

But do understand that statement properly.  This does not mean that Jesus’ life is only about what He taught.  It’s not as if He were a great man of wisdom who came to share His wisdom with us.  Though that statement is true, it fails to reveal the full truth of Jesus and His mission.

So what was He all about?  He was about preaching Himself as THE Truth that is spoken.  Jesus IS the full revelation of the Father in Heaven and is the revelation of ALL Truth.  Therefore, Jesus’ statement means that He came to share Himself, in His fullness, with all people.  He came to share Himself with those He preached to, literally, as He traveled from village to village.  It means that He continues to share Himself with all of us every time we listen to and receive His Living Word:  The Living Word of His very life.

### :latin_cross: Meditation
Reflect, today, upon the fact that Jesus desires to “travel” to the village of your mind and heart.  He wants to seek you out and bring not only His words of eternal life, but also His very self.  Let yourself be ministered to by Jesus and allow Him to speak to you with clarity and truth.  

### :pray: Prayer
My Lord of all Truth, I seek You and am open to letting You seek me.  Help me to be open to all that You wish to reveal to me and help me to receive You as the Living Gospel.  Jesus, I trust in You.
