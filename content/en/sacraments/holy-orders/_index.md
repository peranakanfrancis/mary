### A Life of Service
Christ did not leave the Church without a sacrament of leadership and service. Through the various degrees of the Sacrament of Holy Orders, God raises up deacons, priests and bishops to serve, lead and govern the Church as a community of faith. As an ongoing sacrament, Holy Orders is God’s gift of assistance and strength for the preaching of the Word, the administration of the sacraments and the ministry of service leading to the holiness of all.

### What is the Sacrament of Holy Orders?
Those who receive the sacrament of Holy Orders — as a deacon, priest or bishop — are consecrated in Christ’s name “to feed the Church by the word and grace of God.” These servants of God are ordained and given a special role in carrying out Christ’s mission and help Christians imitate Christ’s mission of love and justice. These roles include representing Christ, proclaim the Word of God, community building, missionary work, being servants, advocates for the poor, share Catholic social teachings, evangelize, and be witnesses of God. Priests and Bishops preside at Eucharist.
