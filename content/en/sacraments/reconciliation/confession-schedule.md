During the epidemic, we can receive the grace of God through the sacrament of reconciliation using the following methods:
1. At Church of The Holy Name of Mary
  - Saturday 6PM Evening Mass, confession session starts half an hour before mass.
  - Sunday 830AM Chinese Mass, cofession session starts half an hour before mass.

### Sacramental Prep
Reconciliation preparation begins with First Holy Communion Camp, normally two to three weeks before the conclusion of First Holy Communion Mass for the children.

To receive First Reconciliation, your child must be enrolled in Religious Education classes and First Holy Communion (FHC) Camp. Our Religious Education class registration for 2021 is now closed. Please check back in September 2021 for registration for the 2021/2022 class.
