> All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability. - Acts 2:4

There are three sacraments that are the foundation of Christian life. These sacraments are: [Baptism](sacraments/baptism), Confirmation, and [Communion](sacraments/communion). These three sacraments together are called the Sacraments of Initiation.

### Receive the Holy Spirit
Confirmation is the strengthening of the relationship with God. It seals our life of faith with Christ. Therefore, confirmation can only be celebrated once. It strengthens the Gifts of the Holy Spirit such as, wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord, and the confirmed is able to be better witnesses of Christ.

As one grows and matures in a natural family, so the Sacrament of Confirmation assists a person as he or she matures in the faith. God supports his son or daughter through the strengths of the Holy Spirit, and makes it possible for the person to witness to the faith through word and example. Confirmation makes a person a partner with God in the spreading of the Word.
