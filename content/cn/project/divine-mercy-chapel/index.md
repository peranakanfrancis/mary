This is a house purchased by Fr. Raphael Kang for the families who wanted a conducive place to pray. From the
beginnings of a prayer house, it developed into a chapel as the number of families that moved into the residential area increased. Plans to renovate the prayer house into a chapel were proposed. The renovation work to the chapel was started by Fr. Henry Rajoo who converted the corner lot house into a nice chapel named after Divine Mercy. It was officially blessed on 17.10.2004 by Bishop Antony Selvanayagam, Bishop of Penang.
