The more we are filled with anxiety, the less we are filled with God’s word and spirit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dear friends, fear is a common experience especially during this Pandemic. Let read these bible verses everyday and be encouraged to trust God at all times. You can pick one of your favourite verse and write it down on a paper, stick it in your room so that you can memorise it and remind you that God is always in control.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Psalm 56:4&lt;/strong>
“When I am afraid, in you I place my trust.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1 Peter 5:7&lt;/strong>
“Cast all your worries upon him because he cares for you.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Psalm 55:23&lt;/strong>
“Cast your care upon the LORD, who will give you support. God will never allow the righteous to stumble.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Matthew 11:28&lt;/strong>
“Come to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>John 16:33&lt;/strong>
“I have told you this so that you might have peace in me. In the world you will have trouble, but take courage, I have conquered the world.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>John 14:27&lt;/strong>
“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give it to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled or afraid.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Hebrews 13:5-6&lt;/strong>
“Let your life be free from love of money but be content with what you have, for he has said, &amp;ldquo;I will never forsake you or abandon you. Thus we may say with confidence: &amp;ldquo;The Lord is my helper, (and) I will not be afraid. What can anyone do to me?&amp;quot;”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Psalm 23:1-6&lt;/strong>
“The LORD is my shepherd; there is nothing I lack. In green pastures you let me graze; to safe waters you lead me; you restore my strength. You guide me along the right path for the sake of your name. Even when I walk through a dark valley, I fear no harm for you are at my side; your rod and staff give me courage. You set a table before me as my enemies watch; You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. Only goodness and love will pursue me all the days of my life; I will dwell in the house of the LORD for years to come.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Philippians 4:6-7&lt;/strong>
“Don’t worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done. Then you will experience God’s peace, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Proverbs 3:5-6&lt;/strong>
“Trust in the LORD with all your heart, on your own intelligence rely not; In all your ways be mindful of him, and he will make straight your paths.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Psalm 94:19&lt;/strong>
“When cares increase within me, your comfort gives me joy.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Psalm 34:4&lt;/strong>
“I sought the LORD, who answered me, delivered me from all my fears.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Exodus 14:13&lt;/strong>
“But Moses answered the people, &amp;ldquo;Fear not! Stand your ground, and you will see the victory the LORD will win for you today. These Egyptians whom you see today you will never see again.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Joshua 1:9&lt;/strong>
“I command you: be firm and steadfast! Do not fear nor be dismayed, for the LORD, your God, is with you wherever you go.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Isaiah 41:10&lt;/strong>
“Fear not, I am with you; be not dismayed; I am your God. I will strengthen you, and help you, and uphold you with my right hand of justice.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Isaiah 40:31&lt;/strong>
“They that hope in the LORD will renew their strength, they will soar as with eagles' wings; They will run and not grow weary, walk and not grow faint.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2 Timothy 1:7&lt;/strong>
“For God did not give us a spirit of cowardice but rather of power and love and self-control.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>James 1:2-4&lt;/strong>
“Consider it all joy, my brothers, when you encounter various trials, for you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. And let perseverance be perfect, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Isaiah 26:3&lt;/strong>
“A nation of firm purpose you keep in peace; in peace, for its trust in you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2 Thessalonians 3:16&lt;/strong>
“May the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with all of you.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil; May God rebuke him, we humbly pray; And do thou, O Prince of the Heavenly Host, by the power of God, thrust into hell Satan and all evil spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls.

Raphael Kang for the families who wanted a conducive place to pray. From the
beginnings of a prayer house, it developed into a chapel as the number of families that moved into the residential area increased. Plans to renovate the prayer house into a chapel were proposed. The renovation work to the chapel was started by Fr. Henry Rajoo who converted the corner lot house into a nice chapel named after Divine Mercy. It was officially blessed on 17.10.2004 by Bishop Antony Selvanayagam, Bishop of Penang.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fundraising for New Church</title><link>https://holynameofmarypt.com/en/project/fundraising-for-new-church/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://holynameofmarypt.com/en/project/fundraising-for-new-church/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>Greetings in the Lord !&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With joy and gratitude in our hearts, I invite you to join me in thanking the MEP Priests who journeyed with the community of Permatang Tinggi from 1893 to 1914. The present Church of the Holy Name of Mary, Permatang Tinggi was built in 1928 during the tenure of Fr. Michael Seet, the first local priest, who served in the parish from 1914 to 1919, and again from 1921 to 1937. Ninety years later activity centre, to cater for an even larger community that is expected to expand further due to the housing developments and the new township that is emerging in areas close to the parish.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Church considers the Mass the greatest possible prayer of intercession because it is the perfect offering of Christ to the Father by making present the Paschal Mystery of His death and resurrection. It is a longstanding tradition in the Church that a Priest may be requested to offer a Mass for a specific intention, even when one cannot be physically present at the Mass.&lt;/p>

A chapel was needed for the
parishioners to participate in the parish life. Fr. Anthony Khaw was responsible for constructing this chapel. It started with humble beginnings of a wooden structure on a large plot of land. As time went by, the chapel became too small to cater to the ever increasing number of Catholics. With time, the chapel became old and worn down. Fr. Raphael Kang was instrumental in raising funds to build a new chapel. The present structure is made of concrete.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>St Joseph Chapel at Juru Village</title><link>https://holynameofmarypt.com/en/project/st-joseph-chapel/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://holynameofmarypt.com/en/project/st-joseph-chapel/</guid><description>&lt;p>Eight km away from the village of Permatang Tinggi, is Juru Village.

To cater to the spiritual needs of the parishioners, the Chapel of St. Mary Magdalene was constructed in early 1954. When the number of families living in the village grew, the first chapel was found to be too small and could not cope with the increasing number of families. Fr. Thomas Chin constructed a bigger chapel through donations from the parishioners as well as help from the government.
Bishop Gregory Yong blessed the chapel on 16 September 1969. Additional renovations were done by the
subsequent parish priests. Fr. John Hiong built the bell tower and did some renovations to the chapel and
purchased new pews.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>St Paul The Hermit Chapel at Valdor Estate</title><link>https://holynameofmarypt.com/en/project/st-paul-the-hermit-chapel/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://holynameofmarypt.com/en/project/st-paul-the-hermit-chapel/</guid><description>&lt;p>This chapel is a small shed with the statue of St. Paul the Hermit.
