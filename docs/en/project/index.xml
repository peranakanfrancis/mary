The more we are filled with anxiety, the less we are filled with God’s word and spirit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dear friends, fear is a common experience especially during this Pandemic. Let read these bible verses everyday and be encouraged to trust God at all times. You can pick one of your favourite verse and write it down on a paper, stick it in your room so that you can memorise it and remind you that God is always in control.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Psalm 56:3&lt;/strong>
“When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1 Peter 5:7&lt;/strong>
“Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Psalm 55:22&lt;/strong>
“Give your burdens to the Lord, and he will take care of you.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Matthew 11:28&lt;/strong>
“Come to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>John 16:33&lt;/strong>
“I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>John 14:27&lt;/strong>
“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Hebrews 13:5-6&lt;/strong>
“For God has said, “I will never fail you. I will never abandon you.’ So we can say with confidence, ‘The Lord is my helper, so I will have no fear. What can mere people do to me?”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Psalm 23:1-6&lt;/strong>
“The Lord is my shepherd; I have all that I need. He lets me rest in green meadows; he leads me beside peaceful streams. He renews my strength. He guides me along right paths, bringing honor to his name. Even when I walk through the darkest valley, I will not be afraid, for you are close beside me. Your rod and your staff protect and comfort me. You prepare a feast for me in the presence of my enemies. You honor me by anointing my head with oil. My cup overflows with blessings. Surely your goodness and unfailing love will pursue me all the days of my life, and I will live in the house of the Lord forever.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Philippians 4:6-7&lt;/strong>
“Don’t worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done. Then you will experience God’s peace, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Proverbs 3:5-6&lt;/strong>
“Trust in the Lord with all your heart; do not depend on your own understanding. Seek his will in all you do, and he will show you which path to take.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Psalm 94:19&lt;/strong>
“Whenever my busy thoughts were out of control, the soothing comfort of your presence calmed me down and overwhelmed me with delight.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Psalm 34:4&lt;/strong>
“I prayed to the Lord, and he answered me. He freed me from all my fears.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Exodus 14:13&lt;/strong>
“Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the Lord will bring you today.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Joshua 1:9&lt;/strong>
“This is my command - be strong and courageous! Do not be afraid or discouraged. For the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Isaiah 41:10&lt;/strong>
“Don’t be afraid, for I am with you. Don’t be discouraged, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you. I will hold you up with my victorious right hand.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Isaiah 40:31&lt;/strong>
“Those who trust in the Lord will find new strength. They will soar high on wings like eagles. They will run and not grow weary. They will walk and not faint.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2 Timothy 1:7&lt;/strong>
“For God will never give you the spirit of fear, but the Holy Spirit who gives you mighty power, love, and self-control.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>James 1:2-4&lt;/strong>
“Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Isaiah 26:3&lt;/strong>
“You will keep in perfect peace all who trust in you, all whose thoughts are fixed on You.’&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2 Thessalonians 3:16&lt;/strong>
“Now may the Lord of peace himself give you his peace at all times and in every situation. The Lord be with you all.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

Raphael Kang for the families who wanted a conducive place to pray. From the
beginnings of a prayer house, it developed into a chapel as the number of families that moved into the residential area increased. Plans to renovate the prayer house into a chapel were proposed. The renovation work to the chapel was started by Fr. Henry Rajoo who converted the corner lot house into a nice chapel named after Divine Mercy. It was officially blessed on 17.10.2004 by Bishop Antony Selvanayagam, Bishop of Penang.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fundraising for New Church</title><link>https://holynameofmarypt.com/en/project/fundraising-for-new-church/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://holynameofmarypt.com/en/project/fundraising-for-new-church/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>Greetings in the Lord !&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With joy and gratitude in our hearts, I invite you to join me in thanking the MEP Priests who journeyed with the community of Permatang Tinggi from 1893 to 1914. The present Church of the Holy Name of Mary, Permatang Tinggi was built in 1928 during the tenure of Fr. Michael Seet, the first local priest, who served in the parish from 1914 to 1919, and again from 1921 to 1937. Ninety years later activity centre, to cater for an even larger community that is expected to expand further due to the housing developments and the new township that is emerging in areas close to the parish.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Church considers the Mass the greatest possible prayer of intercession because it is the perfect offering of Christ to the Father by making present the Paschal Mystery of His death and resurrection. It is a longstanding tradition in the Church that a Priest may be requested to offer a Mass for a specific intention, even when one cannot be physically present at the Mass.&lt;/p>

A chapel was needed for the
parishioners to participate in the parish life. Fr. Anthony Khaw was responsible for constructing this chapel. It started with humble beginnings of a wooden structure on a large plot of land. As time went by, the chapel became too small to cater to the ever increasing number of Catholics. With time, the chapel became old and worn down. Fr. Raphael Kang was instrumental in raising funds to build a new chapel. The present structure is made of concrete.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>St Joseph Chapel at Juru Village</title><link>https://holynameofmarypt.com/en/project/st-joseph-chapel/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://holynameofmarypt.com/en/project/st-joseph-chapel/</guid><description>&lt;p>Eight km away from the village of Permatang Tinggi, is Juru Village. Many Catholic families live here. To nurture their spiritual growth, a chapel was built so that masses could be celebrated on certain days of the month, especially during the feast day. Fr. Joseph Liu was instrumental in constructing this chapel, which was blessed by Rt. Rev. Bishop Gregory Yong.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>St Mary Magdalena Chapel at Permatang Tinggi Village</title><link>https://holynameofmarypt.com/en/project/st-mary-magdalena-chapel/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://holynameofmarypt.com/en/project/st-mary-magdalena-chapel/</guid><description>&lt;p>The chapel dates back to the 1950s. To cater to the spiritual needs of the parishioners, the Chapel of St. Mary Magdalene was constructed in early 1954. When the number of families living in the village grew, the first chapel was found to be too small and could not cope with the increasing number of families. Fr. Thomas Chin constructed a bigger chapel through donations from the parishioners as well as help from the government.
Bishop Gregory Yong blessed the chapel on 16 September 1969. Additional renovations were done by the
subsequent parish priests. Fr. John Hiong built the bell tower and did some renovations to the chapel and
purchased new pews.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>St Paul The Hermit Chapel at Valdor Estate</title><link>https://holynameofmarypt.com/en/project/st-paul-the-hermit-chapel/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://holynameofmarypt.com/en/project/st-paul-the-hermit-chapel/</guid><description>&lt;p>This chapel is a small shed with the statue of St. Paul the Hermit. Its construction dates back to 1953 during the time of the estate workers. It was at that time that the statue was placed in one of the sheds near the rubber estate. This shed served as a focal point for the spiritual activities among the estate workers. Although it is humble in it its origin, it serves the community well even till today.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Baptism</title><link>https://holynameofmarypt.com/en/project/sacraments-to-baptism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://holynameofmarypt.com/en/project/sacraments-to-baptism/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Communion</title><link>https://holynameofmarypt.com/en/project/sacraments-to-communion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://holynameofmarypt.com/en/project/sacraments-to-communion/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
