The more we are filled with anxiety, the less we are filled with God’s word and spirit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dear friends, fear is a common experience especially during this Pandemic. Let read these bible verses everyday and be encouraged to trust God at all times. You can pick one of your favourite verse and write it down on a paper, stick it in your room so that you can memorise it and remind you that God is always in control.&lt;/p>

&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Hebrews 13:5-6&lt;/strong>
“For God has said, “I will never fail you. I will never abandon you.’ So we can say with confidence, ‘The Lord is my helper, so I will have no fear. What can mere people do to me?”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Psalm 23:1-6&lt;/strong>
“The Lord is my shepherd; I have all that I need. He lets me rest in green meadows; he leads me beside peaceful streams. He renews my strength. He guides me along right paths, bringing honor to his name. Even when I walk through the darkest valley, I will not be afraid, for you are close beside me. Your rod and your staff protect and comfort me. You prepare a feast for me in the presence of my enemies. You honor me by anointing my head with oil. My cup overflows with blessings. Surely your goodness and unfailing love will pursue me all the days of my life, and I will live in the house of the Lord forever.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Philippians 4:6-7&lt;/strong>
“Don’t worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done. Then you will experience God’s peace, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Proverbs 3:5-6&lt;/strong>

&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Isaiah 40:31&lt;/strong>
“Those who trust in the Lord will find new strength. They will soar high on wings like eagles. They will run and not grow weary. They will walk and not faint.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2 Timothy 1:7&lt;/strong>
“For God will never give you the spirit of fear, but the Holy Spirit who gives you mighty power, love, and self-control.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>James 1:2-4&lt;/strong>
“Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
