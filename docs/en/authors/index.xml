It was built by Fr. Michael Seet in over 3 years period with overwhelming support and cooperation from the parishioners.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The church was based on Gothic architecture design originated from France which often features spires, pinnacles, decorative sculptures, large windows which have tracery such as rose window and window with stained glass. A characteristic of Gothic Church is its height, the verticality suggesting an aspiration to Heaven.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All the main building structures were built and designed locally such as the spire, unique spiral staircase, the tracery pattern ceiling and the rose windows. The bell tower together with the spire is 90 feet high. The spire was constructed with hard wood and plank. The asbestos ceiling was painted with distemper of different colours.&lt;/p>
