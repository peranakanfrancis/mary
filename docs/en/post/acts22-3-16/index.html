<h3 id="-gospel">💌 Gospel</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city. At the feet of Gamaliel I was educated strictly in our ancestral law and was zealous for God, just as all of you are today.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I persecuted this Way to death, binding both men and women and delivering them to prison. Even the high priest and the whole council of elders can testify on my behalf. For from them I even received letters to the brothers and set out for Damascus to bring back to Jerusalem in chains for punishment those there as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“On that journey as I drew near to Damascus, about noon a great light from the sky suddenly shone around me. I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’ I replied, ‘Who are you, sir?’ And he said to me, ‘I am Jesus the Nazorean whom you are persecuting.’ My companions saw the light but did not hear the voice of the one who spoke to me. I asked, ‘What shall I do, sir?’ The Lord answered me, ‘Get up and go into Damascus, and there you will be told about everything appointed for you to do.’</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since I could see nothing because of the brightness of that light, I was led by hand by my companions and entered Damascus. “A certain Ananias, a devout observer of the law, and highly spoken of by all the Jews who lived there, came to me and stood there and said, ‘Saul, my brother, regain your sight.’ And at that very moment I regained my sight and saw him.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Then he said, ‘The God of our ancestors designated you to know his will, to see the Righteous One, and to hear the sound of his voice; for you will be his witness before all to what you have seen and heard. Now, why delay? Get up and have yourself baptized and your sins washed away, calling upon his name.’</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="-reflection">💬 Reflection</h3>
<p>We celebrate, today, one of the greatest conversions ever known.  The conversion of Saul of Tarsus is so significant that it is given the glorious status of a Feast within our Church.  Why?  We could certainly come up with many reasons.  Let’s look at two of them.</p>
<p>First, Saul’s conversion resulted in one of the greatest evangelists our Church has ever known. Saul, who later goes by the name Paul, was a man of incredible zeal and wholehearted commitment to the faith. He was zealous before becoming a follower of Christ Jesus and he carried that zeal into his conversion giving his all to the proclamation of the Gospel.</p>
<p>His ministry as an Apostle of Christ resulted not only in the foundation of numerous Christian communities, it also resulted in fourteen letters attributed to him or his followers becoming part of our Sacred Scripture.  His writings are deep, profound and very personal.  His love, zeal and care for the Christian communities he founded shone forth as he was revealed as a true shepherd of God.</p>
<p>Secondly, his conversion comes after a fierce persecution of the newly founded Christian Church.  Saul goes forth from town to town, rounding up new Christians and persecuting them.  The most well-known account of this persecution is when he consents to the stoning of St. Stephen, the first Christian martyr, earlier in the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>The Scripture passage quoted above, which comes from the First Reading of the Mass for today, reveals Jesus appearing to Saul asking him why he is persecuting Him.  Saul, in a confused manner, does not understand that his persecution of the Church is actually a persecution of Jesus Himself.<br>
This revelation Saul receives sets him on a powerful path of conversion.</p>
<p>One truth this reveals is that, at times, we encounter division and even persecution within the Church from one person to another.  This should not shock us or undermine our faith.  Jesus was quite aware of this fact with St. Paul and chose to use him despite his horrible persecution of Christians.  This passage should call us to look at all persecution and discord more as an opportunity than anything.  It’s an opportunity for Jesus to bring great good out of something that is deeply painful.</p>
<h3 id="-meditation">✝️ Meditation</h3>
<p>Reflect, today, upon your own experience of discord and division within the Church or even within your own family.  Though it is important to acknowledge the pain and hurt this produces, do not lose hope that God can turn all things into good and use everything for His glory.</p>
<h3 id="-prayer">🙏 Prayer</h3>
<p>Lord, I see the hurt, confusion and division within Your Church and even within my own family.  I see conflict and discord within the whole of society.  As I see and encounter these hardships, give me hope so that I can trust in Your divine plan as You permit all things for Your glory.  Jesus, I trust in You.</p>
