&lt;p>Fr. Michael Seet A Swee, born in 1883, was the “architect” who built the church of Holy Name of Mary, Permatang Tinggi. He ordained a priest in 1911 at Batu Gajah. He was the parish priest of the church of Holy Name of Mary in 1914-1919 and 1921-1937. He died in 18.6.1946. According to his memoir, he stepped out in faith to build the church with only $7000 in hands. From the parishioners of Permatang Tinggi he raised $2012. He reached out as far as Bangkok to raise $1779 and Singapore $10219. The parishioners of Permatang Tinggi contributed 400 days of labour, 10 days each family. The whole church was built with cement bricks which were made on the spot with the sand found here. The stained glass windows of St. Anne and St Joachim and the 6 statues on the pillars were re-cycle items taken from the church of the Assumption, Penang. The Statue of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception above the high altar was taken from former old church. Fr. Michael Seet only bought the statues of Sacret Heart, St. Joseph and the Blessed Virgin Mary (Black Madona). The total cost of building the church was $21816.64. Fr. Michael Seet was very proud that Andrew Teoh Yew Chye could construct the Rose Windows, the High Altar and the spiral staircase.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bells, Do (Andretta), Mi (Carolina) and So (Attonia), were sponsored ($750) by Chan Tek Yee from Singapore. Fr. Michael Seet wished that his successor could buy the other Re and Fa bells when the parish is able to. Then on the feast days beautiful harmony could be heard.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-church-builder">The Church Builder&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The late Teoh Yew Chye was the contractor of the Church of Holy Name of Mary at Permatang Tinggi in 1928 when he was just 23 years old. The then Bishop was so impressed with his work and recommended him to build churches in Butterworth and Taiping, IJ Sisters convent schools in Tanah Rata, BM, SG Petani and La Salle Brother schools in Teluk Intan, St Xavier&amp;rsquo;s Branch School in Penang and large extension of St Michael Institution, Ipoh.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-church-architecture">The Church Architecture&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Church of Holy Name of Mary was based on Gothic architecture design originated from France which often features spires, pinnacles, decorative sculptures, large windows which have tracery such as rose window and window with stained glass. A characteristic of Gothic Church is its height, the verticality suggesting an aspiration to Heaven. All the main building structures were built and designed locally such as the spire, unique spiral staircase, the tracery pattern ceiling and the rose windows. The bell tower together with the spire is 90 feet high. The spire was constructed with hard wood and plank. The asbestos ceiling was painted with distemper of different colours.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Holy Name of Mary Church has existed for 85 years. It was built by Fr. Michael Seet in over 3 years period with overwhelming support from parishioners. The Church Opening ceremony was on 1.11.1928 with Fr Michael Seet Bishop Dovals, priests and all parishioners. Photo below shows the original stairway which has been replaced by tarmac access.&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The history of the parish of the Holy Name of Mary finds its origin from the Catholic Church of St. John the Baptist in Batu Kawan. When a good number of Chinese and Indians settled down there for agricultural purposes, the priests from the Assumption Church, Pulau Pinang, came to look after their spiritual and material needs, The records of Baptism, Marriage, Confirmation and burial of St. John the Baptist Church in Batu Kawan, records, the parish of St. John the Baptist was established from 1838 - 1890, a total of 52 are kept in the archives of Permatang Tinggi parish. According to the earliest and the latest records, the parish of St. John the Baptist was established from 1838 - 1890, a total of 52 years of missionary works in Batu Kawan.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the year 1846, Rev. Fr. Couellon built St. John the Baptist Church in Batu Kawan, for years of missionary works in Batu Kawan. the service of the Catholics there well as to reach the whole of Province Wellesley. He even Batu Kawan were destroyed by pests, the Catholics have lost confidence and started to move learned Tamil in order to preach the Good News to them. Later the agricultural products of out of Batu Kawan; some to Cherok Tok Kun (Bukit Mertajam), some to Machang Bubok (Pagar Tras), some to Permatang Tinggi. So the priests also followed them to these places, where they built Chapels, doctrine houses, which became the earliest places of worship for these Catholics.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>
&lt;p>In the year 1850, Fr. Tisserang was transferred from Singapore to the North, and he brought with him the Minor Seminary, know as St. Mary&amp;rsquo;s College, which he set up in Singapore, to Matang Tinggi, where it functioned for about ten years. He put up a big house of 2 storeys, upstairs were the quarters for the priests and seminarians, downstairs were the classroom and doctrine house. On both sides of the house there were school buildings, one for the girls, the other for the boys. Later on one became the quarters for the teachers and the Catechist, where children from far away places used to dwell on great feast days, or to
learn catechism. All expenses were met by the parish under the care of the Catechist. In the year 1859, Fr. Pierre, passing through Permatang Tinggi found about 100 Catholics living there, and their crops being destroyed by pests.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>According to the Baptism record, on September 10th, 1893, Fr. Bouheret baptised the first child in Permatang Tinggi. This is the earliest record of the parish of the Holy Name of Mary. Let us take this date as the birthday of this parish.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>In the same year, Fr. Bouheret managed to get 700 acres of land in Jawi for the people to develop. About 50 Catholics responded to this plan. In the year 1900 Fr. Bouheret died a sudden death and was buried in the Catholic Cemetery behind the Church, and Fr. Bes from Bukit Mertajam took charge of Permatang Tinggi. In 1902 he constructed a small chapel in Permatang Tinggi. In 1902 he constructed the small chapel of The Holy Family in Jawi for the Catholics there. The year 1905 saw the Baptism of 25 people in that chapel. According to sayings of the people, each Catholic could get 15 acres of land for cultivation.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fr. Maury was transferred to Permatang Tinggi in 1909 and was succeeded by Fr. Bechera in 1911. Three years later, Fr. Michael Seet became the parish priest. He left Permatang Tinggi in 1919 and two years later, he returned to be the parish priest until 1937, for about 20 years. This is the longest serving record in the history of the parish. During his tenure, the present Church of the Holy Name of Mary was established in 1928; it stands erect by the side of North - South Highway, beautiful and majestic for about 61 years; very strong except the steeple which is in need of repairs. Fr. Seet found time to visit the Catholics in Alor Star, Changlun, Kulim &amp;amp; Junjong. This is the mo prosperous peaceful time in the history of the parish.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most of the Catholics are farmers, living simple life and hard working, but very strong in faith, very dedicated and cooperative, In spite of the difficulties in transport, they walked from Jawi, Junjong, Bukit Teh etc. to attend Sunday Mass. When someone died, they hand-carried the coffin to the Church. They were so wonderfully united and cooperative. Sundays, which was so precious for the Catholics. Some of them had to walk tens of miles, The priest then, had to be in charge of three parishes, there was only a Mass on every three coming down from the hills by feet, yet they were careful about their dresses : long pants, shoes for men; no shorts were allowed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All women had to cover their heads during Mass, like in the time of St. Paul.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For the midnight Mass on Christmas Eve, Catholics coming to church had to tie coconut leaves into bundles and leave them along the road under the trees. When they return home, they will light up these as torches to help them to see their way home.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>During the time of Fr. Michael Seet, all the works were done by the priest with the help of the catechist. In spite of the organisation of the Catholic Action as a consultative body, all decisions were done by the priest. For the construction of the parish church, all Catholics took part, either by offering cash or labour: carrying water from the rivers transporting sands, laying bricks etc. There was a strong sense of unity and cooperation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For the opening of the Church, a hundred over seminarians and professors from the College General in Penang, took part in the solemn celebrations, which was very rare to see in those days. In 1927, Santa Maria School was officially opened with three classes ranging from Standard 1 - 6; The headmaster of the school from then until now were Mr. Loh Tao Yuan, Mr. Wong Ching Shan, Mr. Choo Kuek Soo, J. Baptist and Mr. Lim Yoon Hock.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There was a full time catechist, living at the end of the school building, to look after the needs of the Catholics.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol start="6">
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>During the Second World War the church was badly affected! The Japanese occupied the whole of Malaya. It was so unsafe in the cities, a good number of priests came to live in the parish as refugees. Fr. Anthony Khaw was in charge of the parish from 1949 - 1952. During this time (1952) he built the St. Anne chapel in Valdor Village. The Santa Maria School was forced to close down because of the emergency laws. New villages were set up against the spread of communism; a new school was put up by the Goverment in Permatang Tinggi New Village, where there were eighty Catholic families.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In 1954 Fr. Thomas Chin built a small chapel and the priest&amp;rsquo;s quarters there, and began to celebrate Mass in Chinese. In 1969, he managed to put up the present St. Magdalena&amp;rsquo;s chapel and the presbytery near the Holy Name of Mary church. After Fr. Michael Seet, Fr. Thomas Chin was the second longest serving parish priest; from 1952 - 1955, 1959 - 1970.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>During the time of Emergency, a part of the church land was acquired by the Goverment to built the police station, which later was turned into a home for the aged.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol start="7">
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In 1970, Fr. Joseph Liu was posted to this parish and he continued the works of Fr. Thomas Chin and built the St. Joseph&amp;rsquo;s Chapel in Juru Village for the pastoral needs of the Catholics there. In 1978 he organised the Golden Jubilee celebrations of the Parish Church with a great procession through the village. He also repaired the chapel in Valdor, and engaged a lady catechist to teach catechism in the new villages.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Catholics here are mostly Teochew, educated in Mandarin, with 50 families of Indian educated in English. Mandarin is used mainly in church services, with one Mass in Tamil on Third Sunday, one Mass in English on the 4th Sunday of each month.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol start="8">
&lt;li>
&lt;p>In 1984 Fr. John Hiong was sent by the Bishop to take over from Fr. Martin Lam. He build a Shrine in honour of Our Lady at the back of the church. He also tried to put up a altered the main altar, dismantled the two side wings of the church and used the pillars simple hall for the use of the parishioners. Unfortunately, he contracted the horrible decease. of cancer, and died on the 31st May, 1987. He was buried in the Catholic cemetary behind the priest house.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>In 1987 Fr. Raphael Kang succeeded Fr. John Hiong to look after the parish of The Holy Name of Mary. Through the help of two seminarians, Bro. Michael Cheah and Bro E. Benedict, he updated the parish census, and following the diocesan option, started the Renewed Parish Project. He proposed to go on with the project of setting up hall, and proposed to develop the church land for a housing project. Because of the shortage of priests he also helped to serve the Catholics in Machang Bubok and Junjong regularly. He also tries to solve the problem of the Church in Valdor Village. During his time, the liturgical, Catechetical, and Finance/Development committees were set up, and personal computer set was purchased for storing data and manage various parish documents.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>From the beginning until now there were 18 parishioners who followed God&amp;rsquo;s call to join priesthood or Religious Life:&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>1 Diocesan priest: Fr. Paul Chin of Sungai Bakap;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>7 Marist Brothers' including one Novice&lt;/li>
&lt;li>8 Infant Jesus Sisters;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 Franciscan Missionaries of The Divine Motherhood Sisters;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 Canossian Novice.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol start="11">
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The parishioners, following the traditional spirit of the pre-Vatican Church, are very obedient and respectful to the priests, leaving everything in their hands, and lacking in the spirit of initiative and active participation. Nothing can get their support unless initiated by the Parish priest. When there is a priest who is full of energy and a good leader, they will be active in Church works and full of piety and cooperation, otherwise they remain quiet and inactive. So the parish is unable to develop consistently.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After the Second Vatican Council, the Church invites all Catholics to foster the spirit of initiative, and rid themselves of the total dependence on the clergy, be actively involve in parish life, this is the true Christian spirit. Through Baptism all Catholic became active parts of the Body of Christ, that is the Church. So the Church is ours; and we are the Church.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The seven sacraments are &lt;a href="sacraments/baptism">baptism&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="sacraments/confirmation">confirmation&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="sacraments/communion">communion&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="sacraments/reconciliation">reconciliation&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="sacraments/anointing">anointing&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="sacraments/matrimony">matrimony&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="sacraments/holy-orders">holy orders&lt;/a>. They are divided into three categories: &lt;strong>&lt;em>sacraments of initiatio&lt;/em>n&lt;/strong>, &lt;em>&lt;strong>sacraments of healing&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> and &lt;em>&lt;strong>sacraments of communion &amp;amp; mission&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="where-did-the-sacraments-originate">Where did the sacraments originate?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the Bible, Christ gives his followers clear instructions on how to administer and receive each of the sacraments. This is seen through his work with the Apostles, healing the sick, parables, giving his body and blood to nourish our souls and forgiving sinners. The Church administers these holy sacraments as instructed, in order for all to worship God and receive His salvation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="1-the-sacraments-of-initiation">1. The Sacraments of Initiation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The three sacraments of initiation are baptism, confirmation and Eucharist. Each is meant to strengthen your faith and forge a deeper relationship with God. Baptism frees you from original sin, confirmation strengthens your faith and Eucharist allows you to taste the body and blood of eternal life and be reminded of Christ’s love and sacrifice.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="baptism">Baptism&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Baptism is the first sacrament where you become united with Christ and the Church – no other sacrament can be received without it. A priest performs this rite by immersing the baptismal candidate into water, therefore cleansing their original sin through water and the word. The candidate traditionally wears white garments, a candle is lit and they are anointed with sacred chrism. This is the first step in your relationship with God and Christ. Usually this takes place when the candidate is a baby, however, it’s never too late and you’re never too old to begin your journey with God. It’s common to have a baptism celebration with friends and family afterwards and give the child baptism keepsakes that will help them grow in their faith.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Matthew 28:19&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Mark 1:9-11&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway. Acts 16:31, 33&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="confirmation">Confirmation&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This is the sacrament that follows Baptism as part of the initiation process with God and the Church, where the candidate receives the gift of the Holy Spirit and continues their journey with Christ. During Confirmation, the candidate is anointed on the forehead with chrism by a bishop. Since baptism typically happens when the candidate is a baby, confirmation is a great way for an older child to acknowledge that they still want to continue their journey with God and grow their relationship with Him. Celebrate your child’s confirmation by giving them a Bible with meaningful verses highlighted or cross as a daily reminder of God’s love.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be terrified; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go. Joshua 1:9&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.” John 8:12&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="communion">Communion&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Communion (or Eucharist) means thanksgiving. This is when Christ’s body and blood are offered and then received by the parishioner in the form of bread and wine. Christ during the Last Supper broke bread, ate it, gave it to his disciples and told them to eat it. Now the priest, through the words of consecration, blesses and administers the Holy Communion during every mass to remind followers that they are one with Christ. Food and drink nourishes our bodies ‒- Christ’s blood and body nourishes us spiritually.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Is not the cup of blessing which we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ? Is not the bread which we break a sharing in the body of Christ? Since there is one bread, we who are many are one body; for we all partake of the one bread. 1 Corinthians 10:16-17&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>While they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and after a blessing, He broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, “Take, eat; this is My body.” And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you; for this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins. Matthew 26:26-28&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles. All the believers were together and had everything in common. They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need. Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts. Acts 2:42-46&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="4-the-sacraments-of-healing">4. The Sacraments of Healing&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The two sacraments of healing are penance and anointing the sick. Penance allows for spiritual healing and absolution for people who have distanced themselves from God through sin. Anointing the sick allows for both physical and spiritual healing. When one falls seriously ill, a minister anoints them and prays over them, calling on Christ to strengthen and heal.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="reconciliation">Reconciliation&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>During the sacrament of Reconciliation (or Penance), one confesses their sins to God through a priest who forgives their sins by God’s mercy, and orders them to live a more faithful life through absolution. Confession is essential to cultivating and fruitfully living out the word of God. We’re not perfect people, even if we try to be. It feels so much better to confess some of those things you have done wrong and receive forgiveness. This helps us have a stronger relationship with God.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>No, I say to you: but unless you shall do penance, you shall all likewise perish. Luke 13:3&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>But if the wicked do penance for all his sins which he hath committed, and keep all my commandments, and do judgment, and justice, living he shall live, and shall not die. Ezekiel 18:21
Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper, but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy. Proverbs 28:13&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="anointing">Anointing&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This sacrament is only bestowed upon those who are seriously ill or suffering, which then unites the inflicted with Christ’s passion. Anointing the forehand and hands of the person with chrism while a priest administers a special blessing is how this sacrament is received. This special blessing is one way to make the ill feel strengthened and more connected with God in both mind and body.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. James 5:14&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them. Mark 6:13
This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: “He took our illnesses and bore our diseases.” Matthew 8:17&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="5-the-sacraments-of-communion--mission">5. The Sacraments of Communion &amp;amp; Mission&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Through matrimony and the holy orders, couples and the clergy promise to serve and build up the church community.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="matrimony">Matrimony&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Matrimony (or Marriage) isn’t just a union between man and wife. The devotion husband and wife have to each other, and to Christ, mirrors Christ’s love and service to the church. Through marriage, a couple promises to help build each other up in faith, serve each other and the church and be faithful to each other until death.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.” Jeremiah 29:11&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>For husbands, this means love your wives, just as Christ loved the church. He gave up his life for her. Ephesians 5:25&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. And God blessed them. And God said to them, ‘Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” Genesis 1:27-28&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="holy-orders">Holy Orders&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This sacrament is for those who choose to become a priest, bishop or deacon. Through ordination, they are able to perform sacred duties and serve the church community. This is not a sacrament that everyone partakes in, rather it’s one that people feel called to by God.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. 1 Peter 2:9&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God, which he obtained with his own blood. Acts 20:28&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Matthew 16:19&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="living-out-the-sacraments">Living Out the Sacraments&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Receiving one of the seven sacraments is a life-changing moment where one truly experiences God’s salvation and Christ’s sacrifice. Events like first communion are exciting and deserve special gifts. Growing in faith doesn’t only happen through the sacraments, it happens through daily prayer and devotion. Tools like a rosary, Bible, prayer journal and cross can assist you in practicing your faith.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you know anyone about to partake in a sacrament or looking for tools to nourish their faith, consider blessing them in their journey with special religious gifts. It will be a keepsake that will stay with them as their faith continues to deepen.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
