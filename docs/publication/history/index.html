It was built by Fr. Michael Seet in over 3 years period with overwhelming support and cooperation from the parishioners.</p><div class=space-below></div><div class=article-style><h4 id=main-events-of-the-history-of-our-church>Main Events Of The History Of Our Church</h4><ol><li></li></ol><ul><li>The history of the parish of the Holy Name of Mary finds its origin from the Catholic Church of St. John the Baptist in Batu Kawan. When a good number of Chinese and Indians settled down there for agricultural purposes, the priests from the Assumption Church, Pulau Pinang, came to look after their spiritual and material needs, The records of Baptism, Marriage, Confirmation and burial of St. John the Baptist Church in Batu Kawan, records, the parish of St. John the Baptist was established from 1838 - 1890, a total of 52 are kept in the archives of Permatang Tinggi parish. According to the earliest and the latest records, the parish of St. John the Baptist was established from 1838 - 1890, a total of 52 years of missionary works in Batu Kawan.</li><li>In the year 1846, Rev. Fr. Couellon built St. John the Baptist Church in Batu Kawan, for years of missionary works in Batu Kawan. the service of the Catholics there well as to reach the whole of Province Wellesley. He even Batu Kawan were destroyed by pests, the Catholics have lost confidence and started to move learned Tamil in order to preach the Good News to them. Later the agricultural products of out of Batu Kawan; some to Cherok Tok Kun (Bukit Mertajam), some to Machang Bubok (Pagar Tras), some to Permatang Tinggi. So the priests also followed them to these places, where they built Chapels, doctrine houses, which became the earliest places of worship for these Catholics.</li></ul><ol start=2><li><p>In the year 1850, Fr. Tisserang was transferred from Singapore to the North, and he brought with him the Minor Seminary, know as St. Mary&rsquo;s College, which he set up in Singapore, to Matang Tinggi, where it functioned for about ten years. He put up a big house of 2 storeys, upstairs were the quarters for the priests and seminarians, downstairs were the classroom and doctrine house. On both sides of the house there were school buildings, one for the girls, the other for the boys. Later on one became the quarters for the teachers and the Catechist, where children from far away places used to dwell on great feast days, or to
learn catechism. All expenses were met by the parish under the care of the Catechist. In the year 1859, Fr. Pierre, passing through Permatang Tinggi found about 100 Catholics living there, and their crops being destroyed by pests.</p></li><li><p>According to the Baptism record, on September 10th, 1893, Fr. Bouheret baptised the first child in Permatang Tinggi. This is the earliest record of the parish of the Holy Name of Mary. Let us take this date as the birthday of this parish.</p></li><li><p>In the same year, Fr. Bouheret managed to get 700 acres of land in Jawi for the people to develop. About 50 Catholics responded to this plan. In the year 1900 Fr. Bouheret died a sudden death and was buried in the Catholic Cemetery behind the Church, and Fr. Bes from Bukit Mertajam took charge of Permatang Tinggi. In 1902 he constructed a small chapel in Permatang Tinggi. In 1902 he constructed the small chapel of The Holy Family in Jawi for the Catholics there. The year 1905 saw the Baptism of 25 people in that chapel. According to sayings of the people, each Catholic could get 15 acres of land for cultivation.</p></li><li></li></ol><ul><li>Fr. Maury was transferred to Permatang Tinggi in 1909 and was succeeded by Fr. Bechera in 1911. Three years later, Fr. Michael Seet became the parish priest. He left Permatang Tinggi in 1919 and two years later, he returned to be the parish priest until 1937, for about 20 years. This is the longest serving record in the history of the parish. During his tenure, the present Church of the Holy Name of Mary was established in 1928; it stands erect by the side of North - South Highway, beautiful and majestic for about 61 years; very strong except the steeple which is in need of repairs. Fr. Seet found time to visit the Catholics in Alor Star, Changlun, Kulim & Junjong. This is the mo prosperous peaceful time in the history of the parish.</li><li>Most of the Catholics are farmers, living simple life and hard working, but very strong in faith, very dedicated and cooperative, In spite of the difficulties in transport, they walked from Jawi, Junjong, Bukit Teh etc. to attend Sunday Mass. When someone died, they hand-carried the coffin to the Church. They were so wonderfully united and cooperative. Sundays, which was so precious for the Catholics. Some of them had to walk tens of miles, The priest then, had to be in charge of three parishes, there was only a Mass on every three coming down from the hills by feet, yet they were careful about their dresses : long pants, shoes for men; no shorts were allowed.</li><li>All women had to cover their heads during Mass, like in the time of St. Paul.</li><li>For the midnight Mass on Christmas Eve, Catholics coming to church had to tie coconut leaves into bundles and leave them along the road under the trees. When they return home, they will light up these as torches to help them to see their way home.</li><li>During the time of Fr. Michael Seet, all the works were done by the priest with the help of the catechist. In spite of the organisation of the Catholic Action as a consultative body, all decisions were done by the priest. For the construction of the parish church, all Catholics took part, either by offering cash or labour: carrying water from the rivers transporting sands, laying bricks etc. There was a strong sense of unity and cooperation.</li><li>For the opening of the Church, a hundred over seminarians and professors from the College General in Penang, took part in the solemn celebrations, which was very rare to see in those days. In 1927, Santa Maria School was officially opened with three classes ranging from Standard 1 - 6; The headmaster of the school from then until now were Mr. Loh Tao Yuan, Mr. Wong Ching Shan, Mr. Choo Kuek Soo, J. Baptist and Mr. Lim Yoon Hock.</li><li>There was a full time catechist, living at the end of the school building, to look after the needs of the Catholics.</li></ul><ol start=6><li></li></ol><ul><li>During the Second World War the church was badly affected! The Japanese occupied the whole of Malaya. It was so unsafe in the cities, a good number of priests came to live in the parish as refugees. Fr. Anthony Khaw was in charge of the parish from 1949 - 1952. During this time (1952) he built the St. Anne chapel in Valdor Village. The Santa Maria School was forced to close down because of the emergency laws. New villages were set up against the spread of communism; a new school was put up by the Goverment in Permatang Tinggi New Village, where there were eighty Catholic families.</li><li>In 1954 Fr. Thomas Chin built a small chapel and the priest&rsquo;s quarters there, and began to celebrate Mass in Chinese. In 1969, he managed to put up the present St. Magdalena&rsquo;s chapel and the presbytery near the Holy Name of Mary church. After Fr. Michael Seet, Fr. Thomas Chin was the second longest serving parish priest; from 1952 - 1955, 1959 - 1970.</li><li>During the time of Emergency, a part of the church land was acquired by the Goverment to built the police station, which later was turned into a home for the aged.</li></ul><ol start=7><li></li></ol><ul><li>In 1970, Fr. Joseph Liu was posted to this parish and he continued the works of Fr. Thomas Chin and built the St. Joseph&rsquo;s Chapel in Juru Village for the pastoral needs of the Catholics there. In 1978 he organised the Golden Jubilee celebrations of the Parish Church with a great procession through the village. He also repaired the chapel in Valdor, and engaged a lady catechist to teach catechism in the new villages.</li><li>The Catholics here are mostly Teochew, educated in Mandarin, with 50 families of Indian educated in English. Mandarin is used mainly in church services, with one Mass in Tamil on Third Sunday, one Mass in English on the 4th Sunday of each month.</li></ul><ol start=8><li><p>In 1984 Fr. John Hiong was sent by the Bishop to take over from Fr. Martin Lam. He build a Shrine in honour of Our Lady at the back of the church. He also tried to put up a altered the main altar, dismantled the two side wings of the church and used the pillars simple hall for the use of the parishioners. Unfortunately, he contracted the horrible decease. of cancer, and died on the 31st May, 1987. He was buried in the Catholic cemetary behind the priest house.</p></li><li><p>In 1987 Fr. Raphael Kang succeeded Fr. John Hiong to look after the parish of The Holy Name of Mary. Through the help of two seminarians, Bro. Michael Cheah and Bro E. Benedict, he updated the parish census, and following the diocesan option, started the Renewed Parish Project. He proposed to go on with the project of setting up hall, and proposed to develop the church land for a housing project. Because of the shortage of priests he also helped to serve the Catholics in Machang Bubok and Junjong regularly. He also tries to solve the problem of the Church in Valdor Village. During his time, the liturgical, Catechetical, and Finance/Development committees were set up, and personal computer set was purchased for storing data and manage various parish documents.</p></li><li><p>From the beginning until now there were 18 parishioners who followed God&rsquo;s call to join priesthood or Religious Life:</p></li></ol><ul><li>1 Diocesan priest: Fr. Paul Chin of Sungai Bakap;</li><li>7 Marist Brothers' including one Novice</li><li>8 Infant Jesus Sisters;</li><li>2 Franciscan Missionaries of The Divine Motherhood Sisters;</li><li>1 Canossian Novice.</li></ul><ol start=11><li></li></ol><ul><li>The parishioners, following the traditional spirit of the pre-Vatican Church, are very obedient and respectful to the priests, leaving everything in their hands, and lacking in the spirit of initiative and active participation. Nothing can get their support unless initiated by the Parish priest. When there is a priest who is full of energy and a good leader, they will be active in Church works and full of piety and cooperation, otherwise they remain quiet and inactive. So the parish is unable to develop consistently.</li><li>After the Second Vatican Council, the Church invites all Catholics to foster the spirit of initiative, and rid themselves of the total dependence on the clergy, be actively involve in parish life, this is the true Christian spirit. Through Baptism all Catholic became active parts of the Body of Christ, that is the Church. So the Church is ours; and we are the Church.</li></ul><div class=gallery><a data-fancybox=gallery-gallery href=/publication/history/gallery/Fr%20Michael%20Seet%20Silver%20Jubilee%20Celebration%20in1936%20%E4%B8%80%E4%B9%9D%E4%B8%89%E5%85%AD%E5%B9%B4%E8%96%9B%E9%BA%A6%E5%85%8B%E7%A5%9E%E7%88%B6%E5%BA%86%E7%A5%9D%E9%93%B6%E5%BA%86.jpg><img src=/publication/history/gallery/_huffec35d434dda453ac75fc2266a6505a_45217_491fc799b05c130796855b6e9cce3f1a.jpg alt></a>
