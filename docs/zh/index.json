The Anointing of the Sick is given to the sick and those who are about to depart from this life. This Sacrament unites the suffering of an ill person with that of Christ. It enables forgiveness of their sins, comfort in their suffering, and restores the spirit. For the dying person, the sacrament is for the preparation for the passing over to eternal life.\nThe Sacrament is administered by a priest or bishop. A penitential rite followed by the Liturgy of the Word opens the celebration. Scripture awakens the faith of the sick and family members and friends to pray to Christ for the strength of his Holy Spirit. The priest lays his hands on the head of the sick person. He then proceeds to anoint, with the blessed Oil of the Sick, the forehead and hands of the sick person (in the Roman Rite). He accompanies these acts with the words, “Through this holy anointing may the Lord in his love and mercy help you with the grace of the Holy Spirit. May the Lord who frees you from sin save you and raise you up” (CCC, no. 1513) Holy Communion may be offered to the dying person.\nTo Receive Anointing of the Sick If you or someone you know are sick and would like to receive the Sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick, please contact our parish Father Louis at +6045887799 or book an appointment as soon as possible. There is no need to wait until the point of death if the illness is serious. The Sacrament may be repeated if the person recovers and becomes ill again, or if the person’s condition worsens.\n","date":1621987200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"zh","lastmod":1621987200,"objectID":"4c86ae210bfdc6d7ebd1c72cb4aac236","permalink":"https://mary2.netlify.app/zh/sacraments/anointing/","publishdate":"2021-05-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/sacraments/anointing/","section":"sacraments","summary":"In the course of life, humans suffer from illnesses of body, mind and spirit.

They are given in this order to bring about the full initiation of the new Christian life. These three sacraments together are called the Sacraments of Initiation.\nFirst Communion is the first time the Eucharist, Christ’s Body and Blood, is received after the Sacrament of Baptism and Confirmation have been received. Through the priest’s holy prayers, bread and wine becomes the Body and Blood of Christ. After the First Communion, we are able to continually receive the sacrament. Whenever we receive Holy Communion (Eucharist) in mass, we are receiving the Sacrament of the Eucharist.

Christ achieved his task of redeeming humanity and giving perfect glory to God, principally by the paschal mystery of his blessed passion, resurrection from the dead, and glorious ascension.\nAt the death of a Christian, whose life of faith was begun in the waters of baptism and strengthened at the Eucharistic table, the church intercedes on behalf of the deceased because of its confident belief that death is not the end nor does it break the bonds forged in life. The Church also ministers to the sorrowing and consoles them in the funeral rites with the comforting word of God and the sacrament of the Eucharist.\nChristians celebrate the funeral rites to offer worship, praise, and thanksgiving to God for the gift of a life which has now been returned to God, the author of life and the hope of the just. The Mass, the memorial of Christ’s death and resurrection, is the principal celebration of the Christian funeral.\nThe Church through its funeral rites commends the dead to God’s merciful love and pleads for the forgiveness of their sins. At the funeral rites, especially at the celebration of the eucharistic sacrifice, the Christian community affirms and expresses the union of the Church on earth with the Church in heaven in the one great communion of saints. Though separated from the living, the dead are still at one with the community of believers on earth and benefit from their prayers and intercession. At the rite of final commendation and farewell, the community acknowledges the reality of separation and commends the deceased to God. In this way it recognizes the spiritual bond that still exists between the living and the dead and proclaims its belief that all the faithful will be raised up and reunited in the new heavens and a new earth, where death will be no more.\nThe celebration of the Christian funeral brings hope and consolation to the living. While proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ and witnessing to Christian hope in the resurrection, the funeral rites also recall to all who take part in them God’s mercy and judgment and met the human need to turn always to God in times of crisis.\n","date":1621900800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"zh","lastmod":1621900800,"objectID":"f6903bc1e5da40b050a7dc3982e0e1a7","permalink":"https://mary2.netlify.app/zh/mass/funeral/","publishdate":"2021-05-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/mass/funeral/","section":"mass","summary":"In the face of death, the Church confidently proclaims that God has created each person for eternal life and that Jesus, the Son of God, by his death and resurrection, has broken the chains of sin and death that bound humanity.

Because of human weakness, the baptised often do not live up to their dignity as sons and daughters of God. The Sacrament of Reconciliation celebrates the forgiveness and mercy of God as the sinner humbly acknowledges and confesses his or her sins. The Sacrament also repairs or reestablishes a person’s unity with and membership in the Church. The priest represents both God and the Church, and speaks the consoling words of absolution in the name of both.\nFive Steps for Reconciliation These are the five steps to reconciliation:\n Introspection: examine our conscience with a prayerful heart and see how we have hurt others in our thoughts, words, and actions. Contrition: admit and have remorse for your sins Change: decide not to commit these sins again. Confession: Forgiveness-confess to a priest and receive absolution Penance: Do the penance that the priest gives you.

Let me share a few.\n  One of my favourites is, “I’m not worthy.” Or from a parent, “He’s not worthy.” My favourite response was, “You are (or he is) not, so get over it.” This always stopped the conversation in its tracks, but I was partly serious in my answer. None of us, including Jorge Bergoglio, is worthy of the priesthood. It is a gift from God. And what a gift it is! All we can do is marvel that the Lord is generous and loving enough to let us share in his priesthood.\n  “I can’t. I’m a sinner.” My answer, “Welcome to the human race!” Aren’t we all sinners? If that were an obstacle, we would have no priests or bishops.\n  “I like girls.” This is normal. Priests do not hate women or dislike sex. But God has called them to a different expression of their love—one that is not focused on one individual, but on all people.\n  “I want to get married and have a family.” The parental version of this is, “I want to have grandchildren.” Again, this tells me that a man is healthy and has a healthy attraction toward others. So the desire is not the obstacle; it is normal. But the Lord calls some to a bigger family: the Church (cf. CCC 1579).\n  “My parents want me to be a doctor, a lawyer, or a pharmacist.” My response to this was twofold: “What do you want to do with your life?” and “You cannot live your parents’ dream. Your life-mission must be your own.” Most parents want the best for their children. But if the Lord is calling him (or her), you may be bucking the Holy Spirit. Many of the great saints were not fulfilling their parents’ dreams for them. Parents have to let their children go.\n  “I’m gay.” That needs to be considered very discreetly. The Church’s ban on homosexuals in religious life or priesthood is very carefully worded and talks about a “deep-seated gay orientation.” A 2005 document states that the Church “cannot admit to the seminary or to holy orders those who practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called ‘gay culture’” (cf. Congregation for Catholic Education). Most religious communities and many dioceses take this prohibition seriously, but do not consider it the final word in all cases.\n  Excuses abound, but if the Lord is truly calling a man or a woman to religious life or priesthood, he or she needs to listen and respond not only for the sake of the Church, but also for our own happiness and fulfilment.\nWhy does the Catholic Church need priests and bishops? In his divine mercy and love, God decided to invite human beings into his administration of the Church. Obviously, God could run things far more efficiently, but love demands including others. Thus, God’s graces and works involve mediation—they come to us by way of human agents.\nThe three orders of deacon, priest, and bishop are various ministries within the Church, whereby God allows men to serve as agents in the administration of the Church. Each order has its specific duties in the form of service for the smooth and proper functioning of the Church.\nWhat is the role of the hierarchy? The hierarchy of the Church includes all those who have received the Sacrament of Holy Orders. Therefore, deacons, priests, and bishops make up the hierarchy within the Church, each with its respective roles of service.\nAn archbishop is a bishop who oversees a group of dioceses as well as his own specific diocese. The archbishop can also call meetings of the other bishops and coordinate various state-wide efforts when appropriate.\nA cardinal can be a layman or an ordained individual belonging to the group (called a college), whose main responsibility is to see to the running of the Church in the absence of a pope and to elect a new pope should the need arise. The living pope can also use the group in various consultative capacities as he sees fit.\nAm I called to religious life? How can I discern that call? A vocation is a gift from God that can be a very mysterious thing. Seldom is it as obvious as the burning bush was for Moses. More often, it is a subtle feeling or sense that maybe God is calling me to serve as a brother, sister, permanent deacon, religious priest, or diocesan priest. Each is a specific call and requires its own unique discernment. But it definitely needs to be checked out.\nGenerally speaking, if one senses a call to religious life or to the diocesan priesthood, the most important things to do are pray, talk to one’s family and friends, talk to a vocation director, and experience the life of the religious community or diocese.\n  ","date":1621897200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1621897200,"objectID":"151469d377e5409c859a96b6fe83ac4a","permalink":"https://mary2.netlify.app/zh/sacraments/holy-orders/sacrament-of-holy-orders/","publishdate":"2021-05-25T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/zh/sacraments/holy-orders/sacrament-of-holy-orders/","section":"sacraments","summary":"And he said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fish for people. - Matthew 4:19\u0026quot;  Having served as a vocation director for 12 years, I have heard most of the excuses for not answering a vocational call.

And it likely goes back to the time when it was called Extreme Unction—the Last Anointing.\nIn their attempt to revitalise all seven sacraments, the bishops of Vatican II not only looked at the way each sacrament was celebrated, but the theology behind each celebration. In the case of the Sacrament of Anointing of the Sick, they renewed the theology, gave it a new name, and revised the ritual. Let’s look at what they did and why.\nMoments of mental or physical illness can be times of crisis. They can mean a time of loss and pain, a time of insight and growth, or anything in between (cf. CCC 1501). Regardless, our loving God wants to be a part of our experience. He wants to share our lives with us, the bad and the good (cf. CCC 1503). But his presence and support often comes in and through the Church—our faith community. The kind words and help that we receive from others are a part of this, for God works through human means. We need to pay attention to how God works through them.\nThe Church can officially support us through the sacraments. In the case of an illness, that support comes in the form of the Sacrament of Anointing of the Sick (cf. CCC 1511). And, as the ritual clearly states, the focus is life, health, and well-being. But we must remember that a part of the fullness of life is our spiritual lives with God, which begun at Baptism and will inevitably lead to death and resurrection (cf. CCC 1523).\nClearly recognising that human frailty is a part of the reality of life, our loving God is with us through this sacrament to strengthen us when our minds or bodies grow weak. Thus, a person facing a significant surgery is encouraged to avail themselves of this sacrament (cf. CCC 1515), as well as the aged or seriously ill (cf. CCC 1513).\nThe bishops at Vatican II were realistic in recognising human illness and frailty. If death should be the result of the illness, God and his Church assist the journey into new life by offering the Eucharist as Viaticum. Just as the Eucharist nourished us throughout life, so it is nourishment for our travels into new life.\nThis sacrament, then, is not to be viewed as the kiss of death, but one of healing and life.\nIn what way is this a healing sacrament? We see Jesus and the Apostles performing many acts of healing in the Gospels and in the Acts of the Apostles. We may be tempted to believe that God no longer heals since physical healing are less frequent these days, but healing still take place in remarkable numbers. Today, they are often done through the mediation of the medical professions.\nIn the Anointing of the Sick, the focus is on the possibility of both a spiritual and/or a physical healing. The prayers address the sick person as a whole, which includes all aspects of our human life. So while a physical or psychological ailment may be the most obvious cause of the person’s suffering, other aspects of the person’s health are also taken into consideration. Many times, the spiritual healing is far more dramatic than the physical. And sometimes this takes the form of an increased ability to accept the physical illness and its suffering.\nDeath is a reality of our human life, and we need not try to deny that fact when it becomes obvious or inevitable. In such cases, the Sacrament of Anointing prepares a person for death, which includes spiritual healing and the forgiveness of sins. If death is imminent, the Eucharist is offered as Viaticum (food for the journey).\nAs always, the grace of the sacrament and the wisdom and abilities of human nature work together when we face serious illness. We don’t want to highlight one over the other. God works just as effectively through the medical professionals as he does through the sacraments.\nWe want to include the sacraments, however, as a clear statement of faith in God’s presence and care for the suffering. To ignore it would be tantamount to ignoring the doctor.\nDoes one have to be dying to receive it? Canon Law states that anyone who is in some danger of death from an illness or from old age can receive the Sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick. Likewise, should the person’s condition worsen, the sacrament may be repeated (cf. CIC, can. 1004). The Code then immediately offers this caveat: If there is any doubt as to the seriousness of the illness or condition, the sacrament is to be received (cf. CIC, can. 1005). The Catechism of the Catholic Church adds that it is also appropriate to receive the sacrament prior to surgery (cf. CCC, 1515).\nIt must also be remembered that the sacrament is a sacrament of the living. It cannot be offered to one who has already breathed their last breath. But it is appropriate for those near death as it completes our life on earth just as baptism began it (cf. CCC, 1523).\nAs might be expected, this issue requires a great deal of pastoral sensitivity. Age, cultural differences, or differing understandings of the sacraments must all play a part in any decision as to the appropriateness of the administration of this sacrament.\nWhat actually happens during this sacrament? If circumstances allow, the Sacrament of Reconciliation should be celebrated with the sick person prior to the Sacrament of Anointing. If not, there is a brief penitential rite within the introductory prayers.\nThe sacrament consists of readings from the Scriptures, the laying on of hands, the blessing of the oil and the anointing on the forehead and hands, the communal recitation of the Lord’s Prayer, and the dismissal. If the sick person is able to receive Communion, the Eucharist may be offered just after the Lord’s Prayer.\nIt is ideal if the family of the sick person can gather for this ritual. If done in a hospital, the staff also may be invited to participate. The presence of others assures us that the Church is present in prayer. If such presence is not possible, the sacrament can be administered with just the sick person and the priest present.\n  ","date":1621897200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1621897200,"objectID":"87f175886795837dd280bf046bf5352d","permalink":"https://mary2.netlify.app/zh/sacraments/anointing/anointing-for-the-sick/","publishdate":"2021-05-25T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/zh/sacraments/anointing/anointing-for-the-sick/","section":"sacraments","summary":"They drove out many demons, and they anointed with oil many who were sick and cured them. - Mark 6:13\n There is probably no sacrament more misunderstood than the Sacrament of Anointing of the Sick.

CCC 1285). It is about strengthening what God has given, and continues to give, to his sons and daughters (cf. CCC 1302-1303).\nThe Sacrament of Confirmation is not the Catholic equivalent to the Jewish bar mitzvah. Confirmation is not a “coming of age” celebration. True, most young people are just beginning to pass into early adulthood when they receive the sacrament. But Confirmation is not about coming of age. Reception of the Sacrament of Confirmation does not mark the end of formal religious education. We never outgrow a need for a deeper knowledge and appreciation of our faith.\nThe Sacrament of Confirmation is not a rite of passage, nor a graduation from religion class, nor a ratification of a personal faith choice. Rather, it’s all about what God is doing for his beloved daughters and sons.\nAnd what is God doing? Strengthening the divine life which he gave at Baptism, nourishing us in the Eucharist, and reconciling with us in Penance. Why? So that the individual can better defend and witness to the faith through the gifts and workings of the Holy Spirit. And there are—and will be—many situations where we are called upon to defend and witness to our faith. And we need all the help we can get!\nWhat role does the Holy Spirit play in the Sacrament of Confirmation? In the Sacrament of Confirmation, the Holy Spirit completes the grace of baptism and offers the newly confirmed strength as a true witness of Christ. Thus, the newly confirmed is “more strictly obliged to spread and defend the faith by word and deed” (cf. CCC, 1285). Thus, the Holy Spirit completes what was begun at baptism.\nWould it be better to confirm people when they are adults and can make their own choices? Canon Law states that, except when there is a danger of death, anyone who is baptised and has the use of reason, is properly instructed and disposed, and is able to renew their baptismal commitment, is able to be confirmed. The same code states that the proper age for reception of the sacrament is at the age of reason, unless the episcopal conference decides differently (cf. CIC, can. 891).\nPerhaps the requirement that one be “properly disposed” is the key to when the sacrament is received. Proper disposition refers to the recipient’s willingness to cooperate with the gifts of the sacrament, which can happen at almost any age. But nowhere is the sacrament described as a ratification of the recipient’s choice or decision about the faith. Rather, it is the gifts of the Spirit offered to give the recipient the courage and strength to witness and serve—two responsibilities implied in baptism—which are the grace and focus of the sacrament.\nThus, it is important not to view the Sacrament of Confirmation as a rite of passage, a ratification of a personal choice, or a graduation from religious instruction. Rather, it is to be viewed, as are all of the sacraments, as a distinctive working of God in a person’s life.\nHow does this sacrament benefit us in our adult lives as Catholics? The Sacrament of Confirmation helps a person remain faithful to his or her baptismal commitment to witness to Christ and to serve others. The gifts of the Holy Spirit associated with Confirmation are strengths (or virtues) that Christian living requires if it is to be fruitful and complete. Thus wisdom, understanding, knowledge, counsel, fortitude, piety, and fear of the Lord, are divine aids to Christian living without which, fulfilling one’s baptismal calling would be far more difficult, if not impossible.\nPerhaps we don’t recognise these qualities as gifts of strength because they have become a part of our Christian living and appear quite natural — a fact that affirms how closely the Holy Spirit works with us.\n  ","date":1621897200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1621897200,"objectID":"93203b2b4d38500894ed8a1ab1393f8a","permalink":"https://mary2.netlify.app/zh/sacraments/confirmation/sacrament-of-confirmation/","publishdate":"2021-05-25T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/zh/sacraments/confirmation/sacrament-of-confirmation/","section":"sacraments","summary":"And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with different tongues, as the Spirit was giving them the ability to speak out. - Acts 2:4\n Just as Baptism gives new life, Eucharist nourishes life, and Reconciliation restores life when it is broken, Confirmation strengthens that life by the gifts of the Holy Spirit (cf.

Three things are required for a sin to be mortal: serious matter, full consent, and full knowledge (cf. CCC 1858-1859).\nSerious matter means what has been done is just that—serious. It’s something with real consequences; it matters in my life with God and the Church. Our Church helps us by pointing out certain activities that are serious matters—usually significant violations of the 10 Commandments.\nFull consent, the second requirement, means that we freely chose to do it. Doing anything with full freedom is rare because we are weak human beings who often think we are more free than we really are. Things like fear, peer pressure, laziness, addiction, ignorance, pride, and immaturity, often interfere with being truly free.\nThe same goes with full knowledge. Here we must ask: Did I truly understand and appreciate the ramifications and seriousness of what I did? Did I know it was wrong and fully grasp its sinfulness and its consequences for my life with God, self, and others?\nNow here’s the most important thing to remember: To the degree that I was free or had knowledge of what I was doing, I am responsible for sinning. So I may have done something seriously wrong, but it may not be a serious or mortal sin. It is sinful and should be rooted out of our lives, but may not be mortally so.\nOur loving God understands our human weakness. That is one reason he became human. He is calling us to full life with his Church and with himself.\nWhy can’t I confess my sins directly to God? Why involve a priest? The Book of Genesis relates that God shared authority with human beings by having them rule over the animals. The Book of Exodus tells of God working through the ministry of Moses to liberate the people. The prophets were men who mediated between God and human beings. Jesus sent his disciples out to share in his ministry of healing and preaching.\nGod could obviously have done a better job than Adam and Eve, Moses, the prophets, the disciples, or any one of us. But love allows God to share with humans—even knowing that we will mess up. God chose to make certain people mediators of his love and grace for the good of the entire community so that humans would have a share in his ministry.\nIn each of the sacraments, God’s grace—for it is really his grace that is at the heart of every sacrament—comes to us mediated through people and things. That’s just the way God set it up because of his love for us.\nSo, too, in the Sacrament of Reconciliation. God forgives through the ministry of a priest. And this gives the sacrament a very warm and human aspect as we hear the words of absolution pronounced officially and authoritatively by a priest who not only represents Christ, but the whole Church. We are human beings with senses and emotions. The mediation of God’s graces speaks to our need to hear and sense his words of forgiveness.\nHow important is this sacrament in my daily faith journey? Since we are required to celebrate the Sacrament of Reconciliation only when we are conscious of having committed a mortal sin (cf. CCC, 1457), the sacrament could, theoretically, play a very minimal role in our spiritual life. But that would be very minimalistic to say the least.\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church strongly encourages more frequent celebration of the sacrament, stating that even confession of our less serious sins leads to positive effects. It lists the following: confession helps us form our consciences, helps us resist temptation, allows us to experience the healing touch of Christ, and helps us progress in the life of the Spirit (cf. CCC, 1458).\nFrequent use of the sacrament also helps us stay attuned to our spiritual lives. The more frequently we become aware of the condition of our life with God, self, and others, the better grip we have on both the progress and lack of progress in our spiritual life. It offers a good barometer of how we are doing.\nMaking the Sacrament of Reconciliation a vibrant part of one’s spiritual life—especially if it hasn’t been such in quite a while—basically just requires the decision to begin again. Most priests would be willing to help someone back into the swing of things, knowing that the first time back could be a bit awkward.\n  ","date":1621897200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1621897200,"objectID":"3f116d298bcc2fea79b229649af07ae9","permalink":"https://mary2.netlify.app/zh/sacraments/reconciliation/sacrament-of-reconciliation/","publishdate":"2021-05-25T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/zh/sacraments/reconciliation/sacrament-of-reconciliation/","section":"sacraments","summary":"\u0026ldquo;And all this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation - 2 Corinthians 5:18\u0026rdquo;  What does Confirmation Mean?

The “often” part is encouraged because reception of Communion strengthens our bond with one another, nourishes God’s life within us, and incorporates us more deeply into the life of Jesus (CCC 1324). Thus, it is the ongoing Sacrament of Initiation (CCC 1322). The “worthily” part is a little more complicated.\nWhat would make us worthy to receive Holy Communion? Simple answer: nothing. We are never worthy of so great a gift. But here’s the exciting part: God offers us this great sacrament freely. So why does the Church say we ought to receive Holy Communion worthily?\nSince the sacrament is a source of unity and grace, we need to make sure we are capable and ready to be united and graced. And if we are not in full communion with God and the Church because of something we have done, we need to first get right with God and the Church. We need to fix our situation through the Sacrament of Reconciliation. In some cases, we need to change the way we are living.\nWhat might some of these situations be? For instance, if we are engaging in business practices that cheat customers, destroying the reputation of someone, or if we are not participating at Mass on Sundays and Holy Days, we are running the risk of breaking our relationships with God and the Church.\nBut here’s the good news: As baptised persons, we are God’s daughters and sons. If we are willing to correct our situations, God and the Church are more than willing to forgive and take us back into full union. No questions asked. It is quite easy, but it does depend on our getting our relationships in right order. And then receiving Holy Communion is a clear and honest statement. And then can we say that we are receiving Holy Communion worthily.\nWhat is the correlation between this sacrament and a traditional meal? When we think of a meal, we immediately think of food and drink, and someone to share them with over pleasant conversation. If the conversation is good, the sharing can become the focus of the whole meal as we enter into one another’s lives. But good food and drink play an important supportive role.\nThe Eucharist is a meal with the very same elements, but in a more stylised form. We come together to share bread and wine and to enter into conversation with the Lord as he speaks to us through the Scriptures, symbols, gestures, and prayer. The major difference, however, is that the food and drink become the Body and Blood of Christ and the focal point of the meal. This is due, in part, because the Eucharist is a sacrifice as well as a meal in which the death and resurrection of Jesus is offered to the Father.\nHow long must I fast before receiving the sacrament? The general norm for Roman Catholics who plan to receive Holy Communion is to abstain for at least one hour from all food and drink, except water. Canon Law immediately makes two exceptions. One is for priests who celebrate more than one Mass on the same day. They are to observe the fast before the first Mass. The other exception is for the elderly, infirm, and those who care for them. They can receive at any time even if they have eaten within the previous hour (cf. CIC, can. 919).\nDo I have to confess my sins prior to receiving the Eucharist? Only one who is conscious of having committed mortal sin is required to submit to the Sacrament of Reconciliation (cf. CCC, 1457). Thus, reception of absolution in the Sacrament of Reconciliation is not necessary before receiving Holy Communion unless one is conscious of having committed mortal sin.\nWe might make two caveats concerning this matter. Mortal sin is rare since it is a conscious decision to break away from God and the Church through a serious act, adequate appreciation of the seriousness of the act, and a significant degree of freedom in order to be able to say that one freely chose to do it. Seldom do we enjoy that degree of freedom and level of appreciation.\nThe second caveat is the fact that we are always free and encouraged to celebrate the Lord’s love and mercy in the Sacrament of Reconciliation at any time. We certainly don’t need to wait until we have sinned seriously to celebrate the sacrament.\nHow is the Eucharist a Sacrament of Initiation? Just as people have to eat and drink in order to survive in good health, so our spiritual life needs to be continuously nourished in order to survive. The life begun at baptism and strengthened in confirmation is nourished and fed by the Eucharist. Thus, our initiation into God’s life is an ongoing process as we continue to grow in that life.\n  ","date":1621897200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1621897200,"objectID":"48a1864e30cef243c8553f788a4a122d","permalink":"https://mary2.netlify.app/zh/sacraments/communion/sacrament-of-eucharist/","publishdate":"2021-05-25T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/zh/sacraments/communion/sacrament-of-eucharist/","section":"sacraments","summary":"Jesus said to them, ‘Amen, amen, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life within you.’ - John 6:53\n The Church invites us to celebrate the Eucharist and to receive Holy Communion “often” and “worthily” (CCC 1389).

Like the other sacraments, marriage is not just for the good of individuals, or the couple, but for the community as a whole. The Catholic Church teaches that marriage between two baptized persons is a sacrament. The permanent and exclusive union between husband and wife mirrors the mutual commitment between God and his people.\nDo Catholics ever validly enter into non-sacramental marriages? Yes. Marriages between Catholics and non-Christians, while they may still be valid in the eyes of the Church, are non-sacramental. With permission, a priest or deacon may witness such marriages.\nIf a Catholic wants to marry a non-Catholic, how can they assure that the marriage is recognized by the Church? Catholic must seek permission from the local bishop to marry a non-Catholic. If the person is a non-Catholic Christian, this permission is called a “permission to enter into a mixed marriage.” If the person is a non-Christian, the permission is called a “dispensation from disparity of cult.” Your parish office can assist with the permission process.\nWhy does a Catholic wedding have to take place in a church? For Catholics, marriage is not just a social or family event, but a church event. For this reason, the Church prefers that marriages between Catholics, or between Catholics and other Christians, be celebrated in the parish church of one of the spouses. Only the local bishop can permit a marriage to be celebrated in another suitable place.\nWhen a Catholic marries a non-Catholic, must the non-Catholic promise to raise the children in the Catholic faith? The non-Catholic spouse does not have to promise to have the children raised Catholic. The Catholic spouse must promise to do all that he or she can to have the children baptized and raised in the Catholic faith.\nAre weddings permitted on Sundays or during Lent? Church law allows weddings to be held during most days of the year, except the Triduum. However, many parishes do not schedule weddings on Sundays because of the conflict with regularly scheduled Masses and other parish activities. In addition, some dioceses and parishes do not allow weddings during Lent, a season of penance. Check with your parish office.\nWhat should a couple do when they decide that they want to marry in the Catholic Church? They should contact their parish as soon as possible and make an appointment to talk with the priest, deacon or staff person who is responsible for preparing couples for marriage. All parishes in Malaysia insist that couples attend a marriage preparation program (CMPC) at least six months before the intended date of marriage.\nWhy does the church require engaged couples to participate in a marriage preparation program? Marriage preparation offers couples the opportunity to develop a better understanding of Christian marriage; to evaluate and deepen their readiness to live married life; and to gain insights into themselves as individuals and as a couple. It is especially effective in helping couples to deal with the challenges of the early years of marriage.\nWhat key issues are covered in marriage preparation? Marriage preparation programs help couples to understand the Christian and the human aspects of marriage. Typical topics include: the meaning of marriage as a sacrament; faith, prayer and the church; roles in marriage; communication and conflict resolution; children, parenthood and Natural Family Planning.\nIs there a cost for marriage preparation programs? Most programs charge a modest fee to cover the cost of materials. Programs that require an overnight stay will include an additional cost for rooms and meals. Assistance is frequently available for couples who would otherwise be unable to participate.\nWhat is an annulment? An annulment is a declaration by a tribunal (Catholic church court) that a marriage thought to be valid according to Church law actually fell short of at least one of the essential elements required for a binding union. Unlike civil divorce, an annulment does not erase something that was already there, but rather it is a declaration that a valid marriage was never actually brought about on the wedding day. A declaration of nullity does not deny that a relationship ever existed between the couple, or that the spouses truly loved one another.\nCohabitation and Catholic Church teaching Every act of sexual intercourse is intended by God to express love, commitment and openness to life in the total gift of the spouses to each other. Sexual intercourse outside of marriage cannot express what God intended. Rather, it says something false–a total commitment that the couple does not yet have. This total commitment is possible only in marriage.\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church points out that some couples claim a right to live together if they intend to marry later on. Although the couple may be sincere in their intention, the Catechism stresses that human love is not compatible with “trial marriages.” Rather, “it demands a total and definitive gift of persons to one another.”\nIf you are a cohabiting couple who has chosen to marry, the Catholic Church welcomes your decision to marry, but because cohabitation can have an effect on the marriage, couples are encouraged to explore certain questions with the pastoral minister who is preparing them for marriage.\nCohabitation may raise questions, for example, about the couple’s freedom to marry, that needs to be explored.\n  ","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1557010800,"objectID":"2a5945de16971d759be9622895e9375c","permalink":"https://mary2.netlify.app/zh/sacraments/matrimony/faq-about-catholic-marriage/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/zh/sacraments/matrimony/faq-about-catholic-marriage/","section":"sacraments","summary":"Why does the church teach that marriage is a sacrament?

The Rite prepares the adult inquirers with the aim to receive the Sacraments of Initiation – Baptism, Confirmation and the Eucharist.\nFor whom is RCIA intended?  Adults who are not baptised. Adults who were baptised in another non-Catholic Christian tradition. Baptised adult Catholics who have not completed the Sacraments of Confirmation and Holy Eucharist.  When will the new intake for 2020/2021 commence?  Date: Sunday, 23 August 2021 Time: 2.00pm-5:00pm Venue: ZOOM Conferencing  How do I register for RCIA?  Kindly register online here. \u0026amp; Completing hard copies of the form (available from Parish Office) and returning the completed forms to the Parish Office.  How does RCIA work? RCIA is a spiritual journey of faith. It is an exploration into the unknown that requires courage, persistence, and commitment. Rest assured, as St Augustine of Hippo puts it wonderfully, “To fall in love with God is the greatest romance; to seek him the greatest adventure; to find him, the greatest human achievement”.\nRCIA is a spiritual journey of conversion and renewal of both heart and mind. We are informed, formed, and transformed through Jesus, with Jesus, and in Jesus. No one who sincerely comes to Jesus is not changed.\nThe RCIA journey is communal and not individual. It is a journey which is never meant to be taken alone. The formation process takes place within the context of the community itself. The inquirers pray with the community and are prayerfully supported by it; they reflect on the Catholic faith within the context of the community, and they experience what it means to be a Catholic.\nWhat is expected of me? A desire to learn about the Catholic faith, and a certain level of commitment is expected in attending the 2-hour weekly session. Attendance is expected at the rites that comes with the journey as well.\nAsk questions. Ask any and all questions regarding your concerns about the faith.\nSpend time in prayer daily and to read materials handed out at each session.

Kindly register online here. or completing hard copies of the form (available from Parish Office) and returning the completed forms to the Parish Office.  How does RCIA work? RCIA is a spiritual journey of faith. It is an exploration into the unknown that requires courage, persistence, and commitment. Rest assured, as St Augustine of Hippo puts it wonderfully, “To fall in love with God is the greatest romance; to seek him the greatest adventure; to find him, the greatest human achievement”.\nRCIA is a spiritual journey of conversion and renewal of both heart and mind. We are informed, formed, and transformed through Jesus, with Jesus, and in Jesus. No one who sincerely comes to Jesus is not changed.\nThe RCIA journey is communal and not individual. It is a journey which is never meant to be taken alone. The formation process takes place within the context of the community itself. The inquirers pray with the community and are prayerfully supported by it; they reflect on the Catholic faith within the context of the community, and they experience what it means to be a Catholic.\nWhat is expected of me? A desire to learn about the Catholic faith, and a certain level of commitment is expected in attending the 2-hour weekly session. Attendance is expected at the rites that comes with the journey as well.\nAsk questions. Ask any and all questions regarding your concerns about the faith.\nSpend time in prayer daily and to read materials handed out at each session. The Catholic Church is very rich in her teachings and practices, and it takes a lifetime to continually conform yourself to God.\nLast but not least, be open. Come with an open mind and heart.

Michael Seet A Swee, born in 1883, was the “architect” who built the church of Holy Name of Mary, Permatang Tinggi. He ordained a priest in 1911 at Batu Gajah. He was the parish priest of the church of Holy Name of Mary in 1914-1919 and 1921-1937. He died in 18.6.1946. According to his memoir, he stepped out in faith to build the church with only $7000 in hands. From the parishioners of Permatang Tinggi he raised $2012. He reached out as far as Bangkok to raise $1779 and Singapore $10219. The parishioners of Permatang Tinggi contributed 400 days of labour, 10 days each family. The whole church was built with cement bricks which were made on the spot with the sand found here. The stained glass windows of St. Anne and St Joachim and the 6 statues on the pillars were re-cycle items taken from the church of the Assumption, Penang. The Statue of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception above the high altar was taken from former old church. Fr. Michael Seet only bought the statues of Sacret Heart, St. Joseph and the Blessed Virgin Mary (Black Madona). The total cost of building the church was $21816.64. Fr. Michael Seet was very proud that Andrew Teoh Yew Chye could construct the Rose Windows, the High Altar and the spiral staircase.\nThe bells, Do (Andretta), Mi (Carolina) and So (Attonia), were sponsored ($750) by Chan Tek Yee from Singapore. Fr. Michael Seet wished that his successor could buy the other Re and Fa bells when the parish is able to. Then on the feast days beautiful harmony could be heard.\nThe Church Builder The late Teoh Yew Chye was the contractor of the Church of Holy Name of Mary at Permatang Tinggi in 1928 when he was just 23 years old. The then Bishop was so impressed with his work and recommended him to build churches in Butterworth and Taiping, IJ Sisters convent schools in Tanah Rata, BM, SG Petani and La Salle Brother schools in Teluk Intan, St Xavier\u0026rsquo;s Branch School in Penang and large extension of St Michael Institution, Ipoh.\nThe Church Architecture The Church of Holy Name of Mary was based on Gothic architecture design originated from France which often features spires, pinnacles, decorative sculptures, large windows which have tracery such as rose window and window with stained glass. A characteristic of Gothic Church is its height, the verticality suggesting an aspiration to Heaven. All the main building structures were built and designed locally such as the spire, unique spiral staircase, the tracery pattern ceiling and the rose windows. The bell tower together with the spire is 90 feet high. The spire was constructed with hard wood and plank. The asbestos ceiling was painted with distemper of different colours.\n35th Anniversary of the Dedication of Church of Holy Name of Mary The Holy Name of Mary Church has existed for 85 years. It was built by Fr. Michael Seet in over 3 years period with overwhelming support from parishioners. The Church Opening ceremony was on 1.11.1928 with Fr Michael Seet Bishop Dovals, priests and all parishioners.

When a good number of Chinese and Indians settled down there for agricultural purposes, the priests from the Assumption Church, Pulau Pinang, came to look after their spiritual and material needs, The records of Baptism, Marriage, Confirmation and burial of St. John the Baptist Church in Batu Kawan, records, the parish of St. John the Baptist was established from 1838 - 1890, a total of 52 are kept in the archives of Permatang Tinggi parish. According to the earliest and the latest records, the parish of St. John the Baptist was established from 1838 - 1890, a total of 52 years of missionary works in Batu Kawan. In the year 1846, Rev. Fr. Couellon built St. John the Baptist Church in Batu Kawan, for years of missionary works in Batu Kawan. the service of the Catholics there well as to reach the whole of Province Wellesley. He even Batu Kawan were destroyed by pests, the Catholics have lost confidence and started to move learned Tamil in order to preach the Good News to them. Later the agricultural products of out of Batu Kawan; some to Cherok Tok Kun (Bukit Mertajam), some to Machang Bubok (Pagar Tras), some to Permatang Tinggi. So the priests also followed them to these places, where they built Chapels, doctrine houses, which became the earliest places of worship for these Catholics.   In the year 1850, Fr. Tisserang was transferred from Singapore to the North, and he brought with him the Minor Seminary, know as St. Mary\u0026rsquo;s College, which he set up in Singapore, to Matang Tinggi, where it functioned for about ten years. He put up a big house of 2 storeys, upstairs were the quarters for the priests and seminarians, downstairs were the classroom and doctrine house. On both sides of the house there were school buildings, one for the girls, the other for the boys. Later on one became the quarters for the teachers and the Catechist, where children from far away places used to dwell on great feast days, or to learn catechism. All expenses were met by the parish under the care of the Catechist. In the year 1859, Fr. Pierre, passing through Permatang Tinggi found about 100 Catholics living there, and their crops being destroyed by pests.\n  According to the Baptism record, on September 10th, 1893, Fr. Bouheret baptised the first child in Permatang Tinggi. This is the earliest record of the parish of the Holy Name of Mary. Let us take this date as the birthday of this parish.\n  In the same year, Fr. Bouheret managed to get 700 acres of land in Jawi for the people to develop. About 50 Catholics responded to this plan. In the year 1900 Fr. Bouheret died a sudden death and was buried in the Catholic Cemetery behind the Church, and Fr. Bes from Bukit Mertajam took charge of Permatang Tinggi. In 1902 he constructed a small chapel in Permatang Tinggi. In 1902 he constructed the small chapel of The Holy Family in Jawi for the Catholics there. The year 1905 saw the Baptism of 25 people in that chapel. According to sayings of the people, each Catholic could get 15 acres of land for cultivation.\n    Fr. Maury was transferred to Permatang Tinggi in 1909 and was succeeded by Fr. Bechera in 1911. Three years later, Fr. Michael Seet became the parish priest. He left Permatang Tinggi in 1919 and two years later, he returned to be the parish priest until 1937, for about 20 years. This is the longest serving record in the history of the parish. During his tenure, the present Church of the Holy Name of Mary was established in 1928; it stands erect by the side of North - South Highway, beautiful and majestic for about 61 years; very strong except the steeple which is in need of repairs. Fr. Seet found time to visit the Catholics in Alor Star, Changlun, Kulim \u0026amp; Junjong. This is the mo prosperous peaceful time in the history of the parish. Most of the Catholics are farmers, living simple life and hard working, but very strong in faith, very dedicated and cooperative, In spite of the difficulties in transport, they walked from Jawi, Junjong, Bukit Teh etc. to attend Sunday Mass. When someone died, they hand-carried the coffin to the Church. They were so wonderfully united and cooperative. Sundays, which was so precious for the Catholics. Some of them had to walk tens of miles, The priest then, had to be in charge of three parishes, there was only a Mass on every three coming down from the hills by feet, yet they were careful about their dresses : long pants, shoes for men; no shorts were allowed. All women had to cover their heads during Mass, like in the time of St. Paul. For the midnight Mass on Christmas Eve, Catholics coming to church had to tie coconut leaves into bundles and leave them along the road under the trees. When they return home, they will light up these as torches to help them to see their way home. During the time of Fr. Michael Seet, all the works were done by the priest with the help of the catechist. In spite of the organisation of the Catholic Action as a consultative body, all decisions were done by the priest. For the construction of the parish church, all Catholics took part, either by offering cash or labour: carrying water from the rivers transporting sands, laying bricks etc. There was a strong sense of unity and cooperation. For the opening of the Church, a hundred over seminarians and professors from the College General in Penang, took part in the solemn celebrations, which was very rare to see in those days. In 1927, Santa Maria School was officially opened with three classes ranging from Standard 1 - 6; The headmaster of the school from then until now were Mr. Loh Tao Yuan, Mr. Wong Ching Shan, Mr. Choo Kuek Soo, J. Baptist and Mr. Lim Yoon Hock. There was a full time catechist, living at the end of the school building, to look after the needs of the Catholics.     During the Second World War the church was badly affected! The Japanese occupied the whole of Malaya. It was so unsafe in the cities, a good number of priests came to live in the parish as refugees. Fr. Anthony Khaw was in charge of the parish from 1949 - 1952. During this time (1952) he built the St. Anne chapel in Valdor Village. The Santa Maria School was forced to close down because of the emergency laws. New villages were set up against the spread of communism; a new school was put up by the Goverment in Permatang Tinggi New Village, where there were eighty Catholic families. In 1954 Fr. Thomas Chin built a small chapel and the priest\u0026rsquo;s quarters there, and began to celebrate Mass in Chinese. In 1969, he managed to put up the present St. Magdalena\u0026rsquo;s chapel and the presbytery near the Holy Name of Mary church. After Fr. Michael Seet, Fr. Thomas Chin was the second longest serving parish priest; from 1952 - 1955, 1959 - 1970. During the time of Emergency, a part of the church land was acquired by the Goverment to built the police station, which later was turned into a home for the aged.     In 1970, Fr. Joseph Liu was posted to this parish and he continued the works of Fr. Thomas Chin and built the St. Joseph\u0026rsquo;s Chapel in Juru Village for the pastoral needs of the Catholics there. In 1978 he organised the Golden Jubilee celebrations of the Parish Church with a great procession through the village. He also repaired the chapel in Valdor, and engaged a lady catechist to teach catechism in the new villages. The Catholics here are mostly Teochew, educated in Mandarin, with 50 families of Indian educated in English. Mandarin is used mainly in church services, with one Mass in Tamil on Third Sunday, one Mass in English on the 4th Sunday of each month.   In 1984 Fr. John Hiong was sent by the Bishop to take over from Fr. Martin Lam. He build a Shrine in honour of Our Lady at the back of the church. He also tried to put up a altered the main altar, dismantled the two side wings of the church and used the pillars simple hall for the use of the parishioners. Unfortunately, he contracted the horrible decease. of cancer, and died on the 31st May, 1987. He was buried in the Catholic cemetary behind the priest house.\n  In 1987 Fr. Raphael Kang succeeded Fr. John Hiong to look after the parish of The Holy Name of Mary. Through the help of two seminarians, Bro. Michael Cheah and Bro E. Benedict, he updated the parish census, and following the diocesan option, started the Renewed Parish Project. He proposed to go on with the project of setting up hall, and proposed to develop the church land for a housing project. Because of the shortage of priests he also helped to serve the Catholics in Machang Bubok and Junjong regularly. He also tries to solve the problem of the Church in Valdor Village. During his time, the liturgical, Catechetical, and Finance/Development committees were set up, and personal computer set was purchased for storing data and manage various parish documents.\n  From the beginning until now there were 18 parishioners who followed God\u0026rsquo;s call to join priesthood or Religious Life:\n   1 Diocesan priest: Fr. Paul Chin of Sungai Bakap; 7 Marist Brothers' including one Novice 8 Infant Jesus Sisters; 2 Franciscan Missionaries of The Divine Motherhood Sisters; 1 Canossian Novice.     The parishioners, following the traditional spirit of the pre-Vatican Church, are very obedient and respectful to the priests, leaving everything in their hands, and lacking in the spirit of initiative and active participation. Nothing can get their support unless initiated by the Parish priest. When there is a priest who is full of energy and a good leader, they will be active in Church works and full of piety and cooperation, otherwise they remain quiet and inactive. So the parish is unable to develop consistently. After the Second Vatican Council, the Church invites all Catholics to foster the spirit of initiative, and rid themselves of the total dependence on the clergy, be actively involve in parish life, this is the true Christian spirit. Through Baptism all Catholic became active parts of the Body of Christ, that is the Church. So the Church is ours; and we are the Church.

The seven sacraments are baptism, confirmation, communion, reconciliation, anointing, matrimony and holy orders. They are divided into three categories: sacraments of initiation, sacraments of healing and sacraments of communion \u0026amp; mission.\nWhere did the sacraments originate? In the Bible, Christ gives his followers clear instructions on how to administer and receive each of the sacraments. This is seen through his work with the Apostles, healing the sick, parables, giving his body and blood to nourish our souls and forgiving sinners. The Church administers these holy sacraments as instructed, in order for all to worship God and receive His salvation.\n1. The Sacraments of Initiation The three sacraments of initiation are baptism, confirmation and Eucharist. Each is meant to strengthen your faith and forge a deeper relationship with God. Baptism frees you from original sin, confirmation strengthens your faith and Eucharist allows you to taste the body and blood of eternal life and be reminded of Christ’s love and sacrifice.\nBaptism Baptism is the first sacrament where you become united with Christ and the Church – no other sacrament can be received without it. A priest performs this rite by immersing the baptismal candidate into water, therefore cleansing their original sin through water and the word. The candidate traditionally wears white garments, a candle is lit and they are anointed with sacred chrism. This is the first step in your relationship with God and Christ. Usually this takes place when the candidate is a baby, however, it’s never too late and you’re never too old to begin your journey with God. It’s common to have a baptism celebration with friends and family afterwards and give the child baptism keepsakes that will help them grow in their faith.\n Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Matthew 28:19\n  And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Mark 1:9-11\n  And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway. Acts 16:31, 33\n Confirmation This is the sacrament that follows Baptism as part of the initiation process with God and the Church, where the candidate receives the gift of the Holy Spirit and continues their journey with Christ. During Confirmation, the candidate is anointed on the forehead with chrism by a bishop. Since baptism typically happens when the candidate is a baby, confirmation is a great way for an older child to acknowledge that they still want to continue their journey with God and grow their relationship with Him. Celebrate your child’s confirmation by giving them a Bible with meaningful verses highlighted or cross as a daily reminder of God’s love.\n Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be terrified; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go. Joshua 1:9\n  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16\n  When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.” John 8:12\n Communion Communion (or Eucharist) means thanksgiving. This is when Christ’s body and blood are offered and then received by the parishioner in the form of bread and wine. Christ during the Last Supper broke bread, ate it, gave it to his disciples and told them to eat it. Now the priest, through the words of consecration, blesses and administers the Holy Communion during every mass to remind followers that they are one with Christ. Food and drink nourishes our bodies ‒- Christ’s blood and body nourishes us spiritually.\n Is not the cup of blessing which we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ? Is not the bread which we break a sharing in the body of Christ? Since there is one bread, we who are many are one body; for we all partake of the one bread. 1 Corinthians 10:16-17\n  While they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and after a blessing, He broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, “Take, eat; this is My body.” And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you; for this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins. Matthew 26:26-28\n  They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles. All the believers were together and had everything in common. They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need. Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts. Acts 2:42-46\n 4. The Sacraments of Healing The two sacraments of healing are penance and anointing the sick. Penance allows for spiritual healing and absolution for people who have distanced themselves from God through sin. Anointing the sick allows for both physical and spiritual healing. When one falls seriously ill, a minister anoints them and prays over them, calling on Christ to strengthen and heal.\nReconciliation During the sacrament of Reconciliation (or Penance), one confesses their sins to God through a priest who forgives their sins by God’s mercy, and orders them to live a more faithful life through absolution. Confession is essential to cultivating and fruitfully living out the word of God. We’re not perfect people, even if we try to be. It feels so much better to confess some of those things you have done wrong and receive forgiveness. This helps us have a stronger relationship with God.\n No, I say to you: but unless you shall do penance, you shall all likewise perish. Luke 13:3\n  But if the wicked do penance for all his sins which he hath committed, and keep all my commandments, and do judgment, and justice, living he shall live, and shall not die. Ezekiel 18:21 Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper, but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy. Proverbs 28:13\n Anointing This sacrament is only bestowed upon those who are seriously ill or suffering, which then unites the inflicted with Christ’s passion. Anointing the forehand and hands of the person with chrism while a priest administers a special blessing is how this sacrament is received. This special blessing is one way to make the ill feel strengthened and more connected with God in both mind and body.\n Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. James 5:14\n  And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them. Mark 6:13 This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: “He took our illnesses and bore our diseases.” Matthew 8:17\n 5. The Sacraments of Communion \u0026amp; Mission Through matrimony and the holy orders, couples and the clergy promise to serve and build up the church community.\nMatrimony Matrimony (or Marriage) isn’t just a union between man and wife. The devotion husband and wife have to each other, and to Christ, mirrors Christ’s love and service to the church. Through marriage, a couple promises to help build each other up in faith, serve each other and the church and be faithful to each other until death.\n For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.” Jeremiah 29:11\n  For husbands, this means love your wives, just as Christ loved the church. He gave up his life for her. Ephesians 5:25\n  So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. And God blessed them. And God said to them, ‘Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” Genesis 1:27-28\n Holy Orders This sacrament is for those who choose to become a priest, bishop or deacon. Through ordination, they are able to perform sacred duties and serve the church community. This is not a sacrament that everyone partakes in, rather it’s one that people feel called to by God.\n But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. 1 Peter 2:9\n  Pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God, which he obtained with his own blood. Acts 20:28\n  I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Matthew 16:19\n Living Out the Sacraments Receiving one of the seven sacraments is a life-changing moment where one truly experiences God’s salvation and Christ’s sacrifice. Events like first communion are exciting and deserve special gifts. Growing in faith doesn’t only happen through the sacraments, it happens through daily prayer and devotion. Tools like a rosary, Bible, prayer journal and cross can assist you in practicing your faith.\nIf you know anyone about to partake in a sacrament or looking for tools to nourish their faith, consider blessing them in their journey with special religious gifts. It will be a keepsake that will stay with them as their faith continues to deepen.\n","date":1621900800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1621900800,"objectID":"4d4dcc1780687d659573ae1c6c2fbca6","permalink":"https://mary2.netlify.app/zh/publication/seven-sacraments/","publishdate":"2021-05-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/seven-sacraments/","section":"publication","summary":"The seven sacraments are baptism, confirmation, communion, reconciliation, anointing of the sick, matrimony and holy orders.","tags":["Sacraments"],"title":"The Seven Sacraments","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"f917008f74aa8012979052dcf8dbf864","permalink":"https://mary2.netlify.app/zh/talk/synthesizing/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/talk/synthesizing/","section":"talk","summary":"An example talk using academia's Markdown slides feature.","tags":[],"title":"Synthesizing Qualitative Data","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Welcome to Slides academia\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three  A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/img/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
