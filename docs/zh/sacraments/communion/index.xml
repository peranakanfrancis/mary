&lt;p>Jesus said to them, ‘Amen, amen, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life within you.’ - John 6:53&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The Church invites us to celebrate the Eucharist and to receive Holy Communion “often” and “worthily” (CCC 1389). The “often” part is encouraged because reception of Communion strengthens our bond with one another, nourishes God’s life within us, and incorporates us more deeply into the life of Jesus (CCC 1324). Thus, it is the ongoing Sacrament of Initiation (CCC 1322). The “worthily” part is a little more complicated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What would make us worthy to receive Holy Communion? Simple answer: nothing. We are never worthy of so great a gift. But here’s the exciting part: God offers us this great sacrament freely. So why does the Church say we ought to receive Holy Communion worthily?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the sacrament is a source of unity and grace, we need to make sure we are capable and ready to be united and graced. And if we are not in full communion with God and the Church because of something we have done, we need to first get right with God and the Church. We need to fix our situation through the Sacrament of Reconciliation. In some cases, we need to change the way we are living.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What might some of these situations be? For instance, if we are engaging in business practices that cheat customers, destroying the reputation of someone, or if we are not participating at Mass on Sundays and Holy Days, we are running the risk of breaking our relationships with God and the Church.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But here’s the good news: As baptised persons, we are God’s daughters and sons. If we are willing to correct our situations, God and the Church are more than willing to forgive and take us back into full union. No questions asked. It is quite easy, but it does depend on our getting our relationships in right order. And then receiving Holy Communion is a clear and honest statement. And then can we say that we are receiving Holy Communion worthily.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-the-correlation-between-this-sacrament-and-a-traditional-meal">What is the correlation between this sacrament and a traditional meal?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When we think of a meal, we immediately think of food and drink, and someone to share them with over pleasant conversation. If the conversation is good, the sharing can become the focus of the whole meal as we enter into one another’s lives. But good food and drink play an important supportive role.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Eucharist is a meal with the very same elements, but in a more stylised form. We come together to share bread and wine and to enter into conversation with the Lord as he speaks to us through the Scriptures, symbols, gestures, and prayer. The major difference, however, is that the food and drink become the Body and Blood of Christ and the focal point of the meal. This is due, in part, because the Eucharist is a sacrifice as well as a meal in which the death and resurrection of Jesus is offered to the Father.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-long-must-i-fast-before-receiving-the-sacrament">How long must I fast before receiving the sacrament?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The general norm for Roman Catholics who plan to receive Holy Communion is to abstain for at least one hour from all food and drink, except water. Canon Law immediately makes two exceptions. One is for priests who celebrate more than one Mass on the same day. They are to observe the fast before the first Mass. The other exception is for the elderly, infirm, and those who care for them. They can receive at any time even if they have eaten within the previous hour (cf. CIC, can. 919).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="do-i-have-to-confess-my-sins-prior-to-receiving-the-eucharist">Do I have to confess my sins prior to receiving the Eucharist?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Only one who is conscious of having committed mortal sin is required to submit to the Sacrament of Reconciliation (cf. CCC, 1457). Thus, reception of absolution in the Sacrament of Reconciliation is not necessary before receiving Holy Communion unless one is conscious of having committed mortal sin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We might make two caveats concerning this matter. Mortal sin is rare since it is a conscious decision to break away from God and the Church through a serious act, adequate appreciation of the seriousness of the act, and a significant degree of freedom in order to be able to say that one freely chose to do it. Seldom do we enjoy that degree of freedom and level of appreciation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second caveat is the fact that we are always free and encouraged to celebrate the Lord’s love and mercy in the Sacrament of Reconciliation at any time. We certainly don’t need to wait until we have sinned seriously to celebrate the sacrament.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-is-the-eucharist-a-sacrament-of-initiation">How is the Eucharist a Sacrament of Initiation?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Just as people have to eat and drink in order to survive in good health, so our spiritual life needs to be continuously nourished in order to survive. The life begun at baptism and strengthened in confirmation is nourished and fed by the Eucharist. Thus, our initiation into God’s life is an ongoing process as we continue to grow in that life.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The RCIA is a journey, set forth by the universal Church, for adult inquirers (seekers of faith) who desire to know and follow Jesus Christ and to become a member of the Catholic Church. The Rite prepares the adult inquirers with the aim to receive the Sacraments of Initiation – Baptism, Confirmation and the Eucharist.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="for-whom-is-rcia-intended">For whom is RCIA intended?&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Adults who are not baptised.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adults who were baptised in another non-Catholic Christian tradition.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Baptised adult Catholics who have not completed the Sacraments of Confirmation and Holy Eucharist.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="when-will-the-new-intake-for-20202021-commence">When will the new intake for 2020/2021 commence?&lt;/h3>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="how-does-rcia-work">How does RCIA work?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>RCIA is a spiritual journey of faith. It is an exploration into the unknown that requires courage, persistence, and commitment. Rest assured, as St Augustine of Hippo puts it wonderfully, “To fall in love with God is the greatest romance; to seek him the greatest adventure; to find him, the greatest human achievement”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>RCIA is a spiritual journey of conversion and renewal of both heart and mind. We are informed, formed, and transformed through Jesus, with Jesus, and in Jesus. No one who sincerely comes to Jesus is not changed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The RCIA journey is communal and not individual. It is a journey which is never meant to be taken alone. The formation process takes place within the context of the community itself. The inquirers pray with the community and are prayerfully supported by it; they reflect on the Catholic faith within the context of the community, and they experience what it means to be a Catholic.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-expected-of-me">What is expected of me?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A desire to learn about the Catholic faith, and a certain level of commitment is expected in attending the 2-hour weekly session. Attendance is expected at the rites that comes with the journey as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ask questions. Ask any and all questions regarding your concerns about the faith.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Spend time in prayer daily and to read materials handed out at each session. The Catholic Church is very rich in her teachings and practices, and it takes a lifetime to continually conform yourself to God.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last but not least, be open. Come with an open mind and heart. Be open and you will be surprised by God and the splendour of truth in the Catholic Church.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="my-schedule-doesnt-permit-me-to-attend-all-the-sessions-on-a-weekly-basis-what-shall-i-do">My schedule doesn’t permit me to attend all the sessions on a weekly basis. What shall I do?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Replacement classes will be held for those who are not able to make it for the particular session.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="i-hear-that-i-need-a-godparentsponsor-in-order-to-become-a-catholic-what-is-a-sponsor">I hear that I need a Godparent/Sponsor in order to become a Catholic. What is a Sponsor?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A Godparent/Sponsor is a baptised, confirmed, and practising Catholic, at least 16 years old, who acts as a spiritual companion and is willing to support as you in this RCIA journey, and serves as a spiritual mentor throughout your life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you know of someone who meets the above criteria, you can approach them to be your Godparent/Sponsor. If you don’t, the RCIA team will try to help you find a Godparent/Sponsor.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-does-the-godparentsponsor-do">What does the Godparent/Sponsor do?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Godparent/Sponsor journey with the you by attending the weekly RCIA sessions and also the rites that come with it, and he (or she) should care for you spiritual growth. Together with your Godparent/Sponsor, you discern your readiness to receive the Sacraments of Initiation (Baptism, Confirmation, and the Eucharist). Godparent/Sponsor should always be there to inspire, motivate, guide, and pray for you.&lt;/p>
